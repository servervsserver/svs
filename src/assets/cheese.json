They used sheep milk available in the locality and followed a cheese making process that dates back to 3000 years.\nAbbaye de Belloc is a flat wheel-shaped traditional, farmhouse, unpasteurised, semi-hard cheese made from sheep's milk. It has a natural, crusty, brownish rind with patches of red, orange and yellow. The rind is marked with tiny craters.\nThe cheese has a firm, dense, rich and creamy texture. The taste resembles burnt caramel and there is a distinctive lanolin aroma. Ageing process of the cheese ranges from four to ten months. The younger wheels are made in December while the older in July. Both types of cheese wheels are sent to the market in April."

As it nears maturity, the cheese glows of a deep copper pigmentation to reveal the richness of Burgundian soils.\nOnce the cheese is removed from the wooden box, it turns extremely creamy and velvety.

   "Description": "'Afuega’l Pitu' is one of the oldest Spanish cheeses. It is also famous as one of the most widespread Asturian cheeses.\nThe cheese is produced from cow's full-fat milk in towns that dot the lower basins of river Narcea and river Nalón in the central Asturias-Northern Spain. It is made by curdling in a mould at a temperature of between 20 and 25 degrees, for 10 to 48 hours. During its preparation, animal rennet is added and its interior or rind may also be salted.\nThe cheese comes in different types that are recognized by its form/shape, the ingredients added and the ageing period. And hence, each type is known with a particular name. The type that resembles the shape of a bishop's mitre or inverted flowerpot is called 'Troncado/Atroncáu' (Trunk). If the cheese block is round and resembles a shape of a cloth bag, then it is called 'Trapo/Trapu' (Rag/Cloth). Moreover, if paprika (red chilli or bell pepper powder) is added while making the cheese or the cheese is rolled in paprika taking its red colour, then it is called 'Roxu/Rojo'. This type of Afuega’L Pitu has very strong, spicy flavour as it is always eaten when matured. It is tasted like a \"tapa\" or dessert, generally accompanied by bread. If the cheese is made without adding paprika, then it remains white in colour, and so, is called as 'Blanco/Blancu'. This variety of Afuega’L Pitu has soft, white, light, sticky rind which is usually mouldy. In addition to these types, the length for which the cheese has been aged also defines its varieties such as Cured, Semi-cured or Soft.\nThough this cheese is produced all year round, the best type is the one made during spring and winter as the fat content of the milk is at its highest during these seasons!\nAfuega’l Pitu is eaten either when fresh and slightly aired or once matured after several weeks in a fresh, damp, well-ventilated atmosphere.\nThe name 'Afuega’l Pitu' is derived from the \"bable\" Asturian dialect. It means 'choking cake' because its unusual texture makes the cheese stick to the taster's palate and pharynx. The name 'Afuega’l Pitu' also symbolizes one of the Spanish legendary custom ‘drowning the rooster’ referring to cheese producers feeding a piece of the freshly made cheese to a rooster."

From all of these, hard-core Gouda fans prefer to taste the aged Gouda, as they feel it takes years of maturing to bring out the complex flavours of the cheese.\nAged Gouda is prepared similar to other Gouda cheeses by separating curds and whey through a heating process. It is shaped into a wheel that can be effectively sliced into wedged for consumption. As with all other cheeses, aged Gouda gets its colour by adding a colouring agent called annatto. With ageing, Gouda develops calcium lactate crystals formed by the lactic acid in the cheese. It proffers an enjoyable crunch that is unique to waxed cheeses. However, the rind of a five-year aged Gouda is unfit for human consumption.\nGouda affinage\nThe longer a cheese is kept in maturation cellars, the more aromatic and full-flavoured it becomes. Similarly, Aged Gouda such as a five-year aged cheese develops such a strong flavour that cheese aficionados prefer to eat it alone. Accompaniments seem pale in comparison to its caramel and robust flavour.\nGouda cheese as a hard cheese goes well with beer and red wines. The taste of Vintage or Aged Gouda gets a new definition when it is paired with some white wines and any fruity wine."

It is said that the Druids and the Gauls had developed the art of making this unique cheese. In 2002 it was separated from the Fourme de Montbrison, an identical cheese, to receive an individual AOC status.\nThe cheese is a traditional, farmhouse blue cheese that can be either co-operative or artisanal. Fourme d'Ambert is more supple and dense than most blues. Milk from cows grazing on either lower or higher mountain pastures is used to produce the cheese. Although the cheese matures in 40 days, it is cave-aged for two-three months for optimum quality. During the ageing time, it is injected with Vouvray moelleux, a sweet white wine. It is easily recognizable by its unusually tall cylindrical shape.\nThe pâté is cream coloured with prominent blue veining. The cheese is inoculated with Penicillium roqueforti spores for the growth of blue veins. Slightly tangy, savoury flavour infused by the bacteria, beautifully complements the distinct notes of butter and cream.\nWine connoisseurs can enjoy the cheese with Sauternes and other dessert wines as well as full-bodied reds such as Rhone’s, Pinot Noirs and Syrah. Similar cheeses include Fourme de Montbrison, Bleu de Montbrison, Bleu de Gex and Bleu de Septmoncel. Try the cheese as a snack with bread and fruit or crumble it on salads."

   "Description": "American cheese is processed cheese made from a blend of milk, milk fats and solids, other fats and whey protein concentrate. At first, it was made from a mixture of cheeses, more often than not Colby and Cheddar. Since blended cheeses are no longer used, it cannot be legally called “cheese” and has to be labelled as “processed cheese”, “cheese product“, etc. Sometimes, it is called \"American slices\" or \"American singles\" instead of the word cheese. Under the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, American cheese is a type of pasteurised processed cheese.\nThe taste and texture of American cheese vary depending on the usage of cheese and additives. Also, the colour may change from orange, yellow to white as decided by the food manufacturer.\nProcessed American cheese is sold in three varieties – individually wrapped cheese slices, small pre-sliced blocks and large blocks. Before cheese slices were invented, cheese block was the only available option and hence is also considered \"classic\" or \"traditional\" American cheese.\nAlthough criticized for its high fat and sodium content, American cheese is still used in cooking as it melts well and contains a good amount of calcium and protein."

It is mildly salted and usually served at breakfast with honey, jam or filled in pastries. Fresh Anari should be consumed soon as it is very perishable.

However, it is as strong or robust flavoured as its Hispanic cousin, Cotija.\nAñejo means “aged” in Spanish. When fresh and young the cheese is crumbly and breaks into small pieces very easily. As it ages, the cheese becomes firmer allowing it to be easily shredded or grated. It is frequently used in baking and grilling, particularly in making burritos, enchiladas and tacos."

   "Description": "Armenian string cheese also called as Chechil is formed in long strings twisted together. It is a product that is peelable and when it is peeled, it separates from the larger cheese in strips. Most of the cheeses cannot be peeled because of the way they are processed. The curds are pressed into blocks resulting, the cheese either crumbles or breaks apart. In case of string cheese, the curds are worked into elastic strips, which are then plaited or twisted. This creates fibres of cheese that can be pulled away in strings. Cow, sheep, and goat milk can be used in the preparation of string cheese. It is popular with children as it is an excellent source of protein and calcium.\nIn Middle East countries of Armenia and Syria, traditional string cheese is prepared from goat or sheep’s milk. In some places, it is made from 100% whole cow's milk. The cheese is flavoured with various spices including black cumin, nigella seeds and a unique Middle Eastern spice known as mahleb. The cheese is available in an indefinite plaited loop. In Syria, string cheese is known by its Arabic name ‘jibneh mshallaleh’.Middle Eastern string cheese goes well with Lebanese bread and licorice flavoured Greek liqueur, Ouzo.\nThe flavour of Middle Eastern string cheese varies from velvety, buttery to a sharp, tangy one. Texturally, it is firm and flexible besides giving a thread feeling in the mouth. Many people associate Mozzarella with string cheese as it can be plucked apart in logs."

Asiago d’allevo is matured for different time periods; Mezzano for 4-6 months, Vecchio for more than ten months and Stravecchio for two years. On the other hand, Asiago Pressato made with whole milk is matured for a month and sold fresh as a softer, milder cheese.\nDepending on age, the rinds of Asiago can be straw coloured and elastic to brownish-grey and hard.

Due to the similarity in appearance between Baby Swiss and Lacy cheese, they are sometimes mistaken for one another. However, Lacy cheese has entirely different taste and smell than Baby Swiss.\nDerived from traditional Swiss cheese, Baby Swiss has myriad of small 'eyes'. While its colour ranges from ivory to pale yellow, its mild taste and smooth, creamy texture distinguish it from other types of cheeses. When shredded, Baby Swiss melts well. It is buttery, somewhat nutty and sweet flavour goes well with sweet fruits and berries croissants and muffins, white and red wine, juices and even ice-cold milk.\nBaby Swiss cheese is enjoyed not only in the United States but in Europe and Australia as well!Baby Swiss and Lacy Swiss are two varieties of Swiss cheese. Both come with small holes and a mild flavour. Baby Swiss is made from whole milk, while Lacy Swiss is from low-fat milk."

Granted AOC status in 2003, Banon is a very old, traditional cheese said to date back to the Gallo-Roman era.\nThe cheese is wrapped in a case of chestnut leaves, held in place with raffia. Cheese makers gather the leaves in autumn when they fall off the trees. Some of the producers dip the leaves and raffia in vinegar or eau-de-vie to impart a unique flavour to the cheese.\nBanon is aged for a minimum of two weeks. As it ages further, the soft & sticky cheese develops blue and gray moulds on and under the leaves, leading to a strong and intense flavour.  The casing of leaves protects the washed-rind disc and allows the young, slightly acidic cheese to remain moist. It also imparts a fresh vegetable flavour with a hint of wine. Banon cheeses range from firm, mild and lactic to soft, creamy and tart, with a nutty flavour.\nThe local expertise, Fromage Fort du Mont Ventoux, is manufactured by positioning a young Banon cheese (without chestnut leaves) in an earthenware crock, seasoning it with salt and pepper and pouring over vinegar or local eau-de-vie. The crock is often placed in a cool cellar and the cheese left to ferment, with just the sporadic stir. The longer it is left, the stronger it becomes.\nBanon goes well with crusty baguette, fresh fruits and a glass of dry white wine."

As required by PDO regulations, Allgauer Bergkase is a handmade, artisanal cheese made from raw, silage free milk of cows grazing in the Allgäu Mountains of southwest Germany.\nThe traditional cheese-making process in copper vats, one wheel at the time, produces a firm artisanal cheese that has a spicy flavour and characteristically strong aroma. Longer the ripening time of the cheese (at least 4 months) the more intense the flavour. A whole wheel weighing an average of 60 pounds can be identified by a dark yellow to the brown rind. Wedges of Bergkase will display a flexible but firm pate, light yellow in colour with random pea-sized holes scattered throughout. A cross between Emmental, Appenzeller and Allgauer Bergkase is a high-fat cheese with 62% fat and is mainly consumed in slices, sandwiches, salads and casseroles."

It is wrapped in a waxed, foil or plastic rind.\nBel Paese takes 6 to 8 weeks to mature and comes in several different sizes from small buttons to large 5lb wheels. An original Bel Paese can be identified by a map of Italy and a picture of Antonio Stoppani on the label of the cheese. The American version has a map of United States on the label.\nThe Italian cheese goes well with fruits like apples, pears and figs.

But according to French cheese laws, the cheese came to be made exclusively from cow's milk.\nBleu des Causses has a high-fat content of 45% and is matured for at least seventy days. However, the cheese can also be matured for up to six months in Gorges du Tarn's natural limestone caves to develop a full and fine flavour.\nThe cheese is similar to Blue d'Auvergne in many ways, despite Bleu des Causses having a noticeably firmer, creamier texture and spicy flavours. Bleu des Causses produced in winter and summer slightly differ in texture and flavour. Cheeses made in winter are light in colour than their summer equals. The winter produce also tends to be slightly drier.\nA taste of the Bleu des Causses will proffer a blend of rich milkiness amidst the peppery and spicy notes of the blue mould.

It has been judged as one of the world's 62 best cheeses.\nValençay cheese used to have the shape of a perfect pyramid with a pointed top. But when Napoleon returned to the castle of Valencay after his unsuccessful expedition in Egypt, he saw the cheese, in a fit of rage drew his sword and cut off the top of the cheese. Since then the cheese has always been made with a flattened top.Bloomsdale is rolled in a mixture of pine ash and salt and aged until it forms a beautiful bloom of white mould. As it ages, the cheese starts becoming runnier just below the rind. The flavours will intensify, developing some blue cheese notes though it is not one. The rind extends an earthy taste to the lactic, tangy paste inside."

The first blue cheese factories were recorded to have started in northern New South Wales and Gippsland in the 1930s and 1940s. At present, more than 22 styles of blue cheese are produced in Australia.\nBlue cheese is called so because the cheese cultures have had the mold Penicillium added at the initial stage of the cheesemaking process. The final product is spotted or veined blue-grey or blue-green molds alongside a natural crusty rind and an earthy appearance. The salty and sharp taste, creamy texture and a pungent aroma tend to be the characteristic feature of blue cheese.\nAustralia produces basic three styles of blue cheese – Gorgonzola, Danish and Blue Brie. Taking into account the characteristics, each style is unique. Blue cheese styles are modelled on type and quantity of blue culture added, the way each cheese is spiked, size of the cheese, and maturation of cheese and waxing of cheese."

   "Description": "Blue Vein cheeses also called Blue cheese is a generic term used to describe cheese produced with cow's milk, sheep's milk, or goat's milk and ripened with cultures of the mould Penicillium. The final product is characterized by green, grey, blue or black veins or spots of mold throughout the body. These veins are created during the production stage when cheese is 'spiked' with stainless steel rods to let oxygen circulate and encourage the growth of the mold. This process also softens the texture and develops a distinctive blue flavour.\nPDPhoto.orgThe origin of Blue cheese has an interesting story. It is thought to have been invented by accident when a drunken cheese maker left behind a half-eaten loaf of bread in moist cheese caves. When he returned back, he discovered that the mold covering the bread had transformed it into a blue cheese.\nBlue cheese is also identified by a peculiar smell that comes from cultivated bacteria. The flavour of the cheese depends on the type of blue cheese, shape, size, the climate of the curing and the length of ageing. But it generally tends to be sharp and salty. Some of the famous blue cheeses around the world are Roquefort from France, Gorgonzola from Italy and Stilton from England.\nBlue cheese tastes best when served with crackers, pears, raisins, fruit bread and walnuts. Crumble the cheese and melt it into sour cream, plain yoghurt or mayonnaise as a dressing."

These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep’s milk was used, but over the time cow’s milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer’s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow’s milk with sheep’s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wensleydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire.\nBlue Wensleydale is a handcrafted cheese made exclusively by Wensleydale Dairy Products in the town of Hawes. It was invented by Thomas Nuttall in the late 19th century. The recipe is a variation of the famous Stilton cheese but firmer. It is matured for six months and lightly pressed for only 24 hours before being wrapped in a muslin cloth. The mellow and less salty Blue Wensleydale appeals to many newcomers and cheese connoisseurs alike."

Nowadays, Bocconcini’s are usually made from a mixture of water buffalo and cow’s milk. Since this delicious cheese is perishable, it is best consumed fresh.\nBocconcini, using traditional methods of cheese making and water buffalo’s milk, are still made in the provinces of Naples, Caserta and Salerno, as bocconcini alla panna di bufala. The process involves the use of freshly made Mozzarella di Bufala Campana DOP mixed with fresh cream. Another variant called Bocconcino di Bufala Campana DOP is also produced, which is simply, Mozzarella di Bufala Campana DOP in egg sized balls.\n\nThese bite-sized cheeses have a refreshingly delicate and creamy aroma. Because of its elastic texture and consistency, Italians like to savour them in a salad, wrap it in prosciutto or serve them with a spinach dish known as Bocconcini Sorentina. A variety of Italian dishes can be spruced up by the very sweet and very light butter taste of Bocconcini. Slice them on pizzas or vegetable dishes and broil in an oven until the cheese just starts to melt. Confidently pair Bocconcini with white wines such as Sauvignon Blanc and Merlot."

(2 litres a day compared with an average of 5 litres per day for other breeds of a goat). The milk is therefore extremely dense. One finds the aroma of thyme and rosemary in the cheese, typical of the Mediterranean region. Its taste is full of the warm-scented herbs of southern France."

The cones (boulettes) were originally produced from buttermilk and made on farms as a by-product of butter making. Most boulettes are sold fresh and supposed to be eaten within 30 days. But they can also age quite well in ripening cellars where they develop reddish colour due to the effect of paprika or annatto, a natural food colouring.\nThis creamy, fresh cheese is well known for its stinky flavour and is best consumed with a good beer or traditional gin."

Alternatively, Boursault is also known as Lucullus. The cheese invented in 1953 by Henri Boursault has a very high-fat content which lends it a melt-in-the-mouth, creamy soft consistency. With fat per cent tipping the scales at nearly 75%, the ultra-rich buttery taste and very creamy texture of Boursault makes it a favourite dessert cheese. The cheese has a thin, bloomy rind due to a coating of light penicillin mold. Affinage of Boursault takes about two months with one more month in packaging. As the cheese ages, it acquires a mushroomy and a refreshing citrusy taste. The cheese sold in small cylinder shaped rounds should be consumed within a week of purchase. Try pairing this cheese with grapes or pears and light, fruity wines like Vouvray."

After the acquisition of the company by Groupe Bel, production started in the United States for North American distribution. Even though Boursin is available today in more than 30 countries, it has achieved maximum popularity in France.\nBoursin is fresh cream and soft cheese, flavoured with herbs and spices. Although it is just an herb-flavoured French cream cheese that can be easily imitated, only Boursin with its buttery flavour and slightly crumbly texture can be labelled as an “All natural Gournay cheese”.\nToday, the cheese is available in various flavours whose availability varies from country to country. In most cases, Boursin is spiced up with herbs like tomato, onion, chive, fig, nuts, garlic, pepper, shallot, cranberry, fine herbs & cinnamon. A favourite member from the Boursin family is a low-fat version with only 21% fat and is flavoured with garlic & herbs.\nAdd the original Boursin cheese to salads, pasta or serve it as a typical appetizer. It can be spread on crackers and bread or used on raw vegetables such as carrots, celery and peppers. Also, the cheese melts well to create a smooth sauce for pasta and chicken. This cheese is a favourite brand amongst top chefs. Confidently pair, dry white wine or fruity red wine such as Beaujolais with Boursin."

The process of making Brick cheese is borrowed from white American Cheddar, although the resultant produces a slightly soft and distinctly sharper tasting cheese.\nMany associate Brick cheese with Germany’s surface ripened Beer cheese or Beer Käse. The name Brick is derived from the original cheese making process when artisans used Brick to press the moisture out of the cheese.\nAn original Wisconsin Brick cheese is smear-ripened with Corynebacterium and Arthrobacter bacteria to develop a full, earthy flavour. As a Brick cheese matures, the mild and sweet flavour changes to pungent and tangy with a touch of nuttiness. The pate is smooth, open and creamy yellow covered by a washed rind on the outside.\nServe Brick cheese with macaroni, potatoes au gratin, pickled vegetables or on toasted Italian bread. Young Brick cheese goes well with light red wines, Gamay Beaujolais and sweet pickles. Whilst, an aged Brick pairs with robust beers, Porter style ale and hard cider."

Several hundred years ago, Brie was one of the tributes which had to be paid to the French kings.\nIn France, Brie is very different from the cheese exported to the United States. \"Real\" French Brie is unstabilized and the flavour is complex when the surface turns slightly brown. When the cheese is still pure-white, it is not matured. If the cheese is cut before the maturing process, it will never develop properly. Exported Brie, however, is stabilized and never matures. Stabilized Brie has a much longer shelf life and is not susceptible to bacteriological infections.\nBrie is produced from the whole or semi-skimmed cow's milk. Rennet is added into raw milk and heated to a temperature of 37°C to obtain the curd.  The cheese is then cast into moulds, several layers of cheese are filled into the mould and then kept for around 18 hours. After this, the cheese is salted and aged for a minimum of four weeks.\nBrie cheese is slightly pale in colour with a greyish tinge under a rind. Its flavour varies depending upon the ingredients added while producing the cheese.\nBrie, one of the great dessert cheeses, comes as either a 1 or 2-kilogram wheel and is packed in a wooden box. In order to enjoy the taste fully, Brie must be served at room temperature."

The difference between production and maturation places is a typical Brie tradition.\nThis is a raw, soft, unpasteurised cow's milk cheese covered with a bloomy rind resulting from inoculation with Penicillium Candidum molds. As the cheese ages, the rind develops red or brown patches. When nearly half of the straw-coloured pate is ripe and soft, it indicates Brie de Meaux is ready for consumption.\nBrie has a milky and rich taste underlined by sweet and buttery flavours of mushrooms or truffles and almonds.

It was granted an AOC protection in 1980 that requires that the cheese be manufactured under strict guidelines for supreme quality.\nBrie de Melun is produced from either whole or skimmed, raw milk of cows grazing in the valleys of Seine et Marne and some departments of Aube and Yonne. It is semi-soft cheese inoculated with a Penicillium mold and aged in a cellar for at least 4-5 weeks. If the cheese is left to ripen for a longer period, say several months then it matures to a Brie Noir. Since, Brie de Melun is coagulated with lactic acid as opposed to animal rennet it is a vegetarian cheese.\nIt is an aromatic cheese with slightly musty and straw-like smells floating the air. Over-ripening the Brie can result in an unpleasant odor from bacteria that are used to ripen the mould. The texture is semi-soft and the rind slightly dry. As the cheese matures to a Brie Noir, the rind turns darker and crumbly. In addition, the pate is drier and darker and the flavour stronger to taste. The usual flavours are strongly lactic and slightly salty finished by soft, barnyard, sour notes. Brie de Melun is used to prepare regional dishes like croûte au brie.

   "Description": "Brin d’Amour meaning ''a birth of love'', is a Corsican cheese made from the milk of the Lacaune ewes. It is also known by its other name, Fleur de Maquis. This semi-soft cheese has a creamy, firm and moist textured pate covered by a natural, flavoured rind. It takes between 2 weeks to 2-3 months for the cheese to fully ripen.\nThe cheese is covered with an aromatic coating of rosemary, fennel seeds, juniper berries, and the occasional bird's eye chilli during the making process. It has a sour, citrusy taste and feels a bit mild in the mouth. With age, the cheese is dotted with blue-grey molds as the pate absorbs the herbal flavours of the rind. The delicate herbs balance the strong characteristic flavours of the cheese. Because of its musty and nutty aroma, the cheese smells great too. Brin d’Amour matches nicely with Albarino, Riesling and Tempranillo."

The name Bryndza comes from Wallachian, the Romanian word for cheese. There are three types of Bryndza, each prepared differently thus giving the cheese a characteristic texture, taste and colour. Both Slovenská bryndza and Bryndza Podhalańska have been registered in the EU as a PDO cheese in 2008 and 2006, respectively.  There is one more variety of Bryndza that contains only sheep's milk and is called liptovská or ovčia bryndza.While the Slovak variety must have 50% sheep's milk to account for protected designation, the Polish variety of Bryndza contains 60% sheep's milk. In contrast, 100% sheep's milk is used to make liptovská or ovčia bryndza, the least produced variety of Bryndza.The texture, flavour and colour of Bryndza are dependent on how it is made or prepared. Generally, the cheese is quite salty and crumbly if standard salt is used but some producers add saline solution to make it salty, which then changes the texture to soft and spreadable. It is white to gray in colour, tangy to taste and slightly moist. The flavour graph starts from being slightly mild to going strong and then fading with a salty finish. Bryndza is the main ingredient in bryndzové halušky, the national favorite of Slovakia. "

The texture is slightly thicker than clotted cream, comparable to cream cheeses such as mascarpone. Caboc has a mild, sour tang with all the all buttery creaminess and a nutty, chewy edge. It has a fat content of 67%.\nThe recipe for Caboc dates back to the 15th century in the Scottish Highlands. It was cheese for the wealthy, as only the rich had access to rich, soft cheeses called 'White Meats'. Mariota de Ile, the daughter of the chieftain MacDonald of the Isles developed the recipe of Caboc and passed it to her daughter who in due course handed it over to the future generations. The recipe is still kept secret and is only known by Suzannah Stone of Tain, who makes the cheese under her Highland Fine Cheeses Ltd label."

Both these areas are located at the foot of the Picos de Europa Mountains in Asturias.\nThe cheese can be made from unpasteurized cow’s milk or blended with goat and/or sheep milk. It is aged between two and four months in naturally formed limestone caves. Chilly and humid conditions in the caves facilitate the growth of bluish-green penicillium mould on this highly prized cheese. Unlike other blue cheeses injected with Penicillium, Cabrales cures from the outside of the cheese to the inward.\nA finished Cabrales can be characterized by its strong, penetrating aroma and sharp, acidic, slightly salty taste. It pairs well with red wine, fresh figs, salami, sweet sherry and dry sausages. The cheese is treasured as a base for sauces, for melting over grilled or roasted meats and goes well along with baguette slices, crackers, or fruit.\nEarlier, a traditional Cabrales was sold wrapped in moist leaves of Acer pseudoplatanus. But today regulation requires the cheese be sold in a dark-green-coloured aluminium foil with the stamp of the PDO Queso de Cabrales."

In fact, Ragusano DOP from Sicily had to drop the name Caciocavallo Ragusano to achieve the DOP label.\nContinuous exposure to humidity in the caves and aging develops sharp, spicy flavours in Caciocavallo. With persistent aging, the cheese picks up intense, earthy undertones and fruity aromas. Along the way, it turns from a milky white to a darker yellow in colour and becomes more salty.

Its texture and flavour bears resemblance to cheddar, which is the most popular type of cheese in the United Kingdom. This cheese is known as \"the crumblies\".\nThe recipe for Caerphilly has been inspired from other crumbly cheeses like Cheshire, young Lancashire and Wensleydale. It is said that the cheese was specially made for coal-miners as its tough texture and shallow height made it easy for them to eat with bare hands while the salty, moist curd helped to replenish the lost minerals.\nCaerphilly is made from unpasteurised cows' milk and matured anywhere from 8 to 10 to 14 days. Some variants are often kept for up to a year to develop a harder texture and stronger taste. Inside the pale ivory rind of the cheese, young Caerphilly has a fresh and pleasant taste alongside a moist yet supple texture. With maturity, the edges become creamy and the flavour becomes more rounded. It usually has a wheel-shape with ivory-white rind dusted with fine flour. As the cheese ages in a moist cellar, the white and gray moulds become thicker and more leathery. The cheese can be vegetarian depending upon the brand.\nA basic white burgundy would go well with this cheese. It is normally grated or melted onto dishes."

As the cheese matures it forms a smooth, runny interior and a white bloomy rind that is typical to Camenbert cheese. It has a rich, buttery flavour. The rind is bloomy white caused by a white fungus, called penicillium candidum. It is meant to be eaten with the cheese.\nThis cheese is best paired with a light red wine such as Beaujolais, Chenin Blanc, St Emilion, St Estephe or traditionally a glass of Normandy cider.\nOriginal Camembert has AOC designation only if made from raw milk. However, you will find many Camembert cheese made from pasteurised milk both in and outside of France. Young Camembert has a milky and sweet taste, while after ripening it becomes strong and fruity."

   "Description": "Although, Cheddar is originally a product of England, now, Canada produces some of the best cheddar in the world. The climate, soil, pasture, cattle stock, and milk quality separate out superior Canadian Cheddar from the regulars. Unlike other cheddars, Canadian cheddars have a smoother, creamier texture as well proffer the right balance of flavour and sharpness. Depending on their age, the flavour, texture and aroma of cheddar cheese can vary.\nCheddar is traditionally creamy white in colour but due to the addition of tasteless food colouring, it often appears dyed in an orange hue. The cheese can be made from raw, pasteurised or thermalized milk to retain more of the flavour-enhancing enzymes. Even if cow’s milk is the most commonly used source for making the cheese, it is not uncommon to find Canadian cheddar made from sheep or goat's milk. Cheddar ripens from inside out and is classified depending on its ageing time.\nIn Canada, cheddar is produced almost entirely by a number of large companies in Ontario including limited artisanal producers. Of these, the most prize-winning cheddar maker in Canada is the Balderson Cheese Company. The cheese is aged for a minimum of three months and maximum up to six years for optimal supreme quality. Flavoured cheddar cheese spiced up with some popular flavours, made in Canada includes cranberry, dill, flax, garlic, jalapeno, olive and sun-dried tomato. Some of the common types of Canadian Cheddars are Lancashire, Double Gloucester, Wensleydale, Leicester, Derby, Cheshire, Cantal, Caerphilly and Colby.\nMild Cheddar, Medium Cheddar and Marble Cheddar are ideal for snacking and with lighter foods like omelettes, sandwiches and as a garnish. Old Cheddar can be used for shredding, slicing and pairs well with white wines and pale ales/lager. Extra Old Cheddar compliments white wines, red wines & rose wines. It is best used for rich, creamy sauces, shredding, baking."

The PGI protection requires that the cheese be made with between 70% and 90% full ewe's milk and between 10% and 30% full goat's milk.\nThe cheese needs at least 60 days of ripening after which it is sold in cylindrical shapes. Depending on age of the cheese, rind colour can vary from yellow in “primitivo” (early produce) to straw-coloured in “stagionato” (aged) and extra versions. On cutting, a white or light straw yellow Canestrato slice exhibits a sweet and delicate flavour efficacy, which intensifies with aging. An aged cheese will develop an intense and spicy flavour whilst the rind colour could be almost black due to a carbon soot water, vinegar and olive oil treatment.  The cheese contains a minimum of 30% fat. Due to its hard texture, it has a good reputation as a table cheese and pairs well with fresh, raw vegetables and pears. It can also be grated on pasta and soups. Wines such as Greco di Tufo, Falanghina, Lacryma Christi del Vesuvio and Aglianico make a perfect match with the cheese. "

It received an Appellation d'Origine (AOC) status from the administrative region of Cantal in the Auvergne region in 1956. This has ensured that the semi-hard, uncooked, pressed cheese has the features and characteristics attributable to the area of origin.\nThere are three types of Cantal cheese, grouped according to age and texture. Cantal jeune, a young cheese is aged at 30 to 60 days during which it develops a thin gray-ivory crust and a smooth, pale yellow, close-textured paste. It is fresh, sweet, milky in flavour with a light hint of hazelnut, and vanilla.\nCantal Entre-deux, an aged Cantal has the flavours of the green pastures and aromas of butter and cream. From 3 months of ripening, Cantal cheese starts to come into its own.\nCreative Commons/TechniqueA well-aged Cantal Vieux has a thick crust and is a cheese connoisseur’s delight. Due to the lengthy ripening period, the cheese has become more strongly flavoured and is a typical hard cheese with a firm, brittle and crumbly paste. The 8-month stay inside the cellars let Cantal develop a peppery and spicy aroma.\nThe cheese is additionally grouped as “fremier” and “laitier”, wherein fermier is a farmhouse cheese made of raw milk while laitier is the commercial, mass-produced version from pasteurised milk.\nCantal works well with nuts, grapes and apples as well can be used in salads, soups, cheese fondue or gratins. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot are a few wines that pair nicely with Cantal."

   "Description": "Caravane is modern-day’s, first camel cheese produced in the early nineties by Nancy Abeiderrhamane. Its similarity to camembert has earned Caravane the nickname, ‘camelbert cheese’. Her dairy, Tiviski, located in the capital of West African Mauritania makes this cheese with the help of milk collected from the local camel herds. Vegetable rennet and calcium phosphate is used in the cheese-making process for a better and unique yield.\nBy using a special enzyme to achieve the correct consistency, the dairy produces Caravane, a soft cheese with a white crust. It is made using the bloomy-rind technique. Even though it is very difficult to produce this cheese, the low lactose content has a digestive advantage when preparing various dishes requiring less lactose. The cheese is used in cakes, dips, appetizers, savory meat and various vegetable preparations. Its creamy taste creates an exciting pairing with red wine.\nSince the Mauritanians don’t eat much cheese, the EU has not implemented regulation policies for dromedary camel products. This has made it difficult to source the cheese in Europe and America. However, with the help of Gary Guthrie, an American importer, the cheese is now available in select New York stores.\nCaravane is a very healthy cheese as it packs in more nutrients, anti-bacterial enzymes, low fat content and vitamins than regular cow’s, buffalo’s, sheep’s or goat’s cheese. In fact, it has 3 times more nutrients than cow’s milk."

Young cheeses taste & smell chalky, lactic and mildly blue while the older ones are rich & buttery with a well-formed blue colour. Over 18 weeks of maturing, the cheese takes on a robust flavour and is granular in texture. It is one of the finest blue cheeses that relies on it's balance in taste, texture and aroma.\nYoung Cashel Blue pairs well with Gewurztraminer while medium aged wheels favor Sauternes and New World Botrytis Semillion. The aged cheeses are good with LBV Port. Pick the scrumptious cheese to crumble onto salads or snack on with grapes."

Covering the pate is a thin reddish-yellow rind, which turns wrinkly, and brownish-ochre as the cheese matures. The subtle taste of Castelmagno gets stronger, spicier and sharper as it ages.  Castelmagno is a very ancient cheese with origins dating back to 1277, more or less at the same time as Gorgonzola. It is named after a Roman soldier whom despite being persecuted, kept on preaching gospels and gave its name to the famous sanctuary town of Castelmagno in Grana Valley. Barolo, Reciota della Valpolicella, Chianti pair well with this cheese. It is appreciated as a table cheese and used in the preparation of typical Italian dishes such as gnocchi."

It is either round or half-cylinder shape with a rind that is engraved with the mark left by the wooden mould. The greyish-dark brown colour of the rind conceals a yellow coloured pate. This cheese comes from the Spanish region of Castile-Leon, which accounts for 85% production of pure sheep's milk cheese. Castigliano best represents the cheese-producing region.\nThe ripening process of Castigliano lasts at least two months to develop a medium mature and mature age cheese. It comes in pieces ranging between a kilo and 3.5kg. The cheese is similar to Manchego but comparatively, it is quite moist and has a few rice-sized holes. Cheeses made with raw milk such as Castigliano have a spicy, cream-caramel, buttery flavour that is perfectly offset by the fresh acidity and hint of salt. The fruity tang of the table cheese when served with the classic Spanish quince or membrilla, takes the dish to a completely new level. Nowadays, a recent variety of cheese produced with a mixture of cows, ewes and goat’s milk has a somewhat mild flavour. Castigliano cheese goes well with good regional red wines."

Due to the action of the larvae, the cheese becomes very soft and liquid. A different variety of this cheese is also available on the island of Corsica. It is a traditional food of the region and is mostly consumed at weddings and celebrations.\nPlease note: Casu martzu is considered by Sardinian aficionados to be unsafe to eat when the maggots in the cheese have died."

Here, in this case, Chabichou du Poitou is manufactured on a small area in the Poitou, Berry and Perigord regions of France. Made with whole fresh goat’s milk, the cheese won Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in 1990 guaranteeing the authenticity of the produce. The cheese is produced only by a few farmsteads or cheese retailers and is sold locally.\nThe cheese comes in the shape of a truncated cylinder called \"bonde\", approximately 6 cm in height and 5 to 6 cm in diameter. After 10 days of the maturing process, Chabichou contains a minimum 45% fat and comes coated with a thin layer of grey-blue islets. If the cheese is made by a farmstead, it is naturally allowed to develop the mould, whereas Penicillium is inserted into the cheese if made by a dairy. The cheese is sold at a minimum maturing age of 2 weeks but may be matured for five to six weeks to acquire an intense aroma and flavour.\nUpon ageing, Chabichou develops a characteristic, edible wrinkled rind dotted with occasional grey patches. Cut the cheese and it reveals a firm, creamy “bright white” interior but not before unwinding a thin buttery layer. Even though it smells typically “goaty”, the flavours are sweet with a bit of salty and tangy edge at the end. As the cheese ages, it becomes savoury, piquant and nutty. Balance the flavours of the cheese with light white wine, champagne, and pilsner beer."

The cheese is sprinkled with pepper, herbs or ash for that extra kick in texture and flavour.\nIt is recommended that Chabis de Gatine be consumed when it is semi-dry, i.e. the outer layer should be dry, stained greyish blue and the inner pate should be firm yet at the same time smooth.

The cheese pairs ideally with a glass of Pinot Noir, Chardonnay and Cider."

However, many countries all over the world manufacture Cheddar today.\nAny cheese producing company or any of the artisan manufacturers in any corner of the world can label the cheese produced by them as 'Cheddar' since it is not protected like other cheese names or brands. \nCheddar cheese, the most widely purchased and eaten cheese in the world is always made from cow's milk. It is a hard and natural cheese that has a slightly crumbly texture if properly cured and if it is too young, the texture is smooth. It gets a sharper taste as it matures, over a period of time between 9 to 24 months. Shaped like a drum, 15 inches in diameter, Cheddar cheese is natural rind bound in cloth while its colour generally ranges from white to pale yellow. However, some Cheddars may have a manually added yellow-orange colour.\nJoseph Harding, the \"father of Cheddar cheese\" who invented modern cheese making techniques described the ideal quality of original Somerset Cheddar as \"close and firm in texture, mellow in character or quality, rich with a tendency to melt in the mouth and has full and fine flavour somewhat like hazelnut!\""

Reputed to have been made since Roman times, the cheese is also mentioned in the Domesday Book of the 11th century.\nDense and crumbly, Cheshire is made using vegetarian rennet and pasteurised cow’s milk. The taste and flavour of cheese develop with ripening. Young Cheshire is firm, crumbly and white in colour. It is mild, milky and aromatic leaving behind a slightly tangy aftertaste on the palette.\nSometimes, to add a different dimension to the cheese, annatto is added to the milk, which gives Red Cheshire a deep shade of red-orange. However, there is no difference in the flavour and texture in both cousins. Another variant is a Blue Cheshire ripened with Penicillium culture moulds.\nAn aged Cheshire becomes firmer and darkens considerably. It is now a full-flavoured cheese yet with no hint of bitterness. Though still crumbly, the cheese turns dry with maturity.\nCheshire with its lower salt content makes for a perfect crumble on fruits, chutney, and vegetable and baked dishes.\n"

   "Description": "Chevre is French for Goat’s cheese i.e. cheeses made out of goat’s milk. They are popular among elderly and children who are more likely to show low tolerance to cow’s milk. Also, goat cheeses are lower in fat and higher in vitamin A and potassium. They serve as a perfect substitute for many dieters. A majority of goat cheeses come from France, the most famous among them being Bucheron, Chabis and Crottin de Chavignol.\nGoat cheeses have a unique, tart, earthy flavour that sets them apart from cow cheeses. This distinctive tang and aroma grow robust and bold as it ages. Milk production of goats, unlike of cow’s, is seasonal from mid-March through October. Only a few kinds of cheese are aged beyond four months and they cannot be frozen without loss of quality. Considering the availability of limited milk production, experiments are on to make cheeses from frozen goat milk curd.\nThe flavour and aroma of goat cheese rely upon its moisture, density, ageing and flavouring. It can feature a soft, semisoft, firm, or hard texture that indicates its moisture content. They come in many sizes and shapes, such as round patties, log-shapes, drum-shaped, pyramids, round loaves, long loaves etc. Chevres are excellent dessert cheeses, often served as snacks or before dinner drinks."

After Chevrotin was awarded the Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) in 2002, the cheese came to be produced exclusively in the Haute Savoie region of France.\nThe cheese should be a mix of the raw milk of one herd of goats. Produced only a farmstead, milk should come from a herd containing 80% Alpine breed goats. To guarantee the authenticity of the produce and AOC stamp, the diameter of each cheese cylinder must measure 9 to 12cm and a length of 3 to 4.5cm. It should contain 45% fat and weigh between 250 to 350 grams.\nChevrotin des Aravis is a washed rind cheese made similar to a Reblochon, except with goat’s milk. The maturation which lasts for 3-4 weeks results in a fine and smooth paste and a yellowish-orange rind that is moist and tainted with moulds. As with other chevre cheese, it has the odor of goats and flowers with a nearly sweet taste. Being a mountain cheese, it has an inherited aromatic sourness suggestive of wild herbs fed to the goats. Chevrotin des Aravis pairs well with Cotes du Rhone, Bandol, Mondeuse, Chignin-bergeron, Saint-joseph and Savoie wines."

Fresh curds are white, soft and neutral to taste but they are left to ferment to acquire a bit of tanginess. Soft Durkha or Chhurpi is an excellent source of protein and used as a substitute for vegetables in the mountainous region. A curry and/or pickle are made of Chhurpi and is eaten with rice as a staple food in everyday meals. Chhur singba or Chhur mingba is freshly prepared Chhurpi prepared by adding the extract of crab apple fruits (thung).\nHard Durkha or Chhurpi is made out of yak milk. After the curds are cured at room temperature for 2-3 days, the cheese is sliced and left to dry in the sun or dried in the oven on low heat. This type of Chhurpi becomes very hard and lasts many years. If hard Chhurpi is as old as 4 to 5 years, it is called chhurpupu.

In Tibet, these whey curds are called chura loenpa or ser. Most people in Tibet do not add anything to the curd. They just eat it as chura loenpa or shape the curd to dry it. Sometimes melted butter, sugar is added to it and mixed well. The curd is shaped into balls, flat wafers, noodles or beads and left to dry in the sun or dried in the oven on low heat. When the curd dries out well, it is called Chura Kampo, which means hard dried cheese."

   "Description": "Colby cheese, originally called Colby Swiss Cheddar is a semi-hard American cheese prepared from cow’s milk. It is many-a-times compared to cheddar cheese since both are dyed to appear orange, even though they taste radically different. Due to U.S. dairy regulations, Colby cheese is made from cow’s milk and is available at many grocery stores.\nThe cheese was developed in 1874 by Joseph Steinwand at his cheese factory near Colby, Wisconsin. While the cheese looks similar to cheddar due to the colour, Colby cheese is softer, has a more open texture and higher moisture content. The flavour is much milder and creamy if compared to Cheddar. It does not undergo the “cheddaring” process but is instead manufactured with a washed curd process that reduces the acid content making the cheese less tangy.\nAn aged Colby becomes cracked and dry and therefore the cheese is to be eaten as young as possible. Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Shiraz wines pair well with the American cheese. The gentle flavour and texture of Colby gives a new definition to grilled sandwiches, hamburgers, fajitas, rye bread or apples and pears. To accentuate the flavour it is sometimes blended with other cheeses such as Monterey Jack, to make Colby Jack cheese."

This hard mountain cheese is matured to perfection in the silence and darkness of special caves where the cheese gets its unique taste, texture and colour. There are several maturing cellars in the region where Comté is ripened for a minimum of 4 months to 18 or 24 months. A few times, Comté gets its name from the cellar where it has ripened such as Comté Fort Saint-Antoine.\nComté was one of the first few kinds of cheese to receive an AOC (Appellation d'origine controlee) status in 1958. It is one of the most popular AOC cheeses in France with around 40,000 tonnes of annual production.\nConsidered one of the finest cheeses in the world, a wedge of Comte reveals a pale yellow interior and a texture that can vary from silky, flabby to crystalline.\nThere are practically 83 flavours, which can be savoured while tasting Comté. But the main aromatic flavours that delicately linger on the palate are a balance of brown-butter and roasted-nut aromas and a sweet finish.\nIts ability to melt easily means Comté goes well with many recipes right from fondues to Croque Monsieur. The cheese pairs well with Rhone reds, a Palo Cortado or off-dry Amontillado sherry from Spain.\nFromageries Arnaud, the winner of Super Gold medal at the 2014 World Cheese Awards, is one of the top-notch groups in the world to make French certified-origin cheeses. Today, the Fromagerie counts for roughly 12% of the total Comté production.

This hard, crumbly Mexican cheese is made mainly from cow’s milk.\nWhen the cheese is made, it is white, fresh and salty thus bearing immense resemblance to feta cheese. However, with ageing, it becomes hard and crumbly like Parmigiano-Reggiano. Its similarity with Parmesan has earned it the nickname \"Parmesan of Mexico\". The aged version of Cotija is referred to as \"anejo\".\nTraditionally, Cotija cheese was made with raw milk aged for three to twelve months. But the commercial productions add an enzyme to speed up the ripening process. This need for acceleration gives the commercial produce a slight change in flavour compared to the artisanal variety.\nSince, Cotija cheese is very salty, strongly flavoured, firm and does not actually melt, it is used for grating on salads, soups, casseroles, tacos, tostadas and chilli. In Mexico, it is also widely used to enhance the flavour of many savoury dishes by mixing directly into the casserole or recipe. In the U.S. it is increasingly popular on pasta. It is typically shredded onto cooked foods, also in salads and with fruit."

Protected with DOP law, it becomes an extraordinary by its content of vitamins and proteins and also by its calcium and phosphorus rich nature. After the maturation period of natural ageing, its paste offers an extraordinary healthful power with soft and velveteen nature. This cheese is known as \"new\" when it has passed the current year, said to be \"mature\" when it has completed a period of 12 - 18 months. It is called as \"old\" when it reaches a period of 18 - 24 months and \"ultra old\" when it is aged for 24 - 36 months. The quality of each and every cheese is examined by eight factors namely age, maturing degree, fragrance, structure, paste colour, consistency, rind condition and dappling. The shape of cheese is checked by the \"threshing\" and \"dowelling\" processes with the help of specific tools such as the percussion hammer, the screw needle, the plug or probe. The colour of cheese goes from golden straw to pale straw, equally spread over the cheese shape. This typical cheese goes well with Champagne or with the best Italian red wines such as Brunello and Barolo. \nTwo varieties of Cravero Parmigiano Reggiano:\nCravero Parmigiano Reggiano San Pietro - A cheese produced by San Pietro is aged for a year at their farm, then transferred to Cravero family for further aging.

In German, it is also called Doppelrhamstufel meaning cheese made with \"double cream\". The cheese has a mildly lactic aroma and a slightly salty taste.\nCream cheese is firmed with the use of lactic acid and so needs to be consumed fresh. It has a relatively short life even when refrigerated. Cream cheeses made using traditional methods tend to be more crumbly than spreadable while those with stabilizers like guar gum are more firm. The taste, texture and production are similar to Boursin and Mascarpone. Cream cheese is suitable for vegetarians since it uses acid, such as citric acid to coagulate the milk.\nCream cheese has a mild, sweet taste with a pleasant slight tang. It is a smooth, spreadable cheese at room temperature and comes in various flavoured varieties including those with herbs, fruits blended in. The cheese is widely consumed in United States where it used to enrich cheesecakes, frostings, dips, toppings, sweet & savory dishes and desserts. It is also used to make flavourful desserts with colourful fruit combinations such as blueberries, raspeberries and kiwis."

Flavourings such as caraway seeds add a new dimension to the taste of Danbo. When caraway seeds are added to the cheese, Danbo is also known as \"King Christian” cheese, named after King Christian IX who ruled Denmark during the late 19th and early 20th century.\nDepending on low fat, medium or full-fat versions, the fat per cent in Danbo can vary from 15-45%.

While Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk, Double Gloucester uses full fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavourful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses the whole milk taken from two milking or a mixture of milk and cream. The double variety has a smooth and buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour thanks to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used and the cheese is aged for at least 4 months. If the cheese is allowed to age further, it will develop more complex and nutty flavours. Moreover, the texture tends to become very hard and flaky.\nDouble Gloucester participates every year in the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. A traditional British Ale or red like Syrah will perfectly complement a Double Gloucester.\nDouble Gloucester A has won many international awards including Silver medal at 2014 World Cheese Awards."

During those days, only the wealthy and commercial establishments had access to refrigerators. In the summers, middle class households had to store their dairy products in iceboxes cooled with ice blocks. Cheeses could not compete with milk and butter for a place in the icebox and had to fend for themselves.\nConsumers requested for a variant of Monterey Jack that would not become runny in the summers. The solution was Dry Jack, a hard cheese, aged from ten months to upto four years. Firm in texture with a pale yellow pate, the cheese has a rich, nutty yet mild and assertive flavour. As the cheese ages Dry Jack wheels become increasingly brittle. As the cheese is similar in texture to Parmesan, it makes a good substitute for churning and grating over salads, pasta, soups or tacos. The cheese can be shred, cooked, sliced or even eaten as it is. You will never go wrong by grating Dry Jack over casseroles, toasted cheese sandwiches, omelets and soufflés.

A reduced fat Dubliner is also available in the market. The cheese goes well with a full-bodied wine like Cabernet or a pint of Guinness as well as with a fruity wine, Irish wine, or Oaky Chardonnay wine. It tastes delicious if melted between crusty brown bread slices. The cheese is also used to prepare sandwiches, pastas, or served with fruits like apples or pears. Remove the cheese from the fridge 30 minutes before consumption and enjoy 7 days after opening. "

Duddleswell has received many awards including Gold at International Cheese Awards 2010 and 2011 and Bronze at British Cheese Awards 2010. All of the cheeses made at the dairy are suitable for vegetarians since only vegetable rennet is used during processing. Duddleswell pairs well with Merlot.

   "Description": "Queijo de Evora or Evora is a DOP protected semi hard-unpasteurised sheep’s milk cheese from the town of Evora in Southern Portugal. The milk used to make the cheese is from Merino ewe, a breed more popular for its wool. Production for this cheese starts in November and peaks in March and April when milk production is at its highest.\nThe inedible rind and paste of Evora are delicate, pale yellow and quite meaty. Flavours mirror the green pastures and the thistle flower used to coagulate milk. It passes on a slightly bitter but not distasteful flavour to the cheese. This is contrasted by salty, fruity notes and a citrusy tang. As Evora ages, these flavours become more distinct and commanding.\nCrisp white and light to medium-bodied red wines complement the sharp taste of the cheese. Because of its high salt content, Evora particularly suits salads."

These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep’s milk was used, but over the time cow’s milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer’s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow’s milk with sheep’s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wenslydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire.\nExtra Mature Wensleydale, matured for nine months is the strongest Wensleydale produced by Wensleydale Creamery. It is placed on shelves in the atmospherically - controlled maturing room. Wensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of cheeseboard where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavours rule the roost. It complements fruity white wine such as Pinot Grigio."

The cheese is protected by EU legislation and only those cheeses manufactured in Macedonia, Thrace, Thessaly, Central Mainland Greece, the Peloponnese, Lesvos and Island of Kefalonia can be called ‘feta’. Similar cheeses produced elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean and around the Black Sea, outside the EU, are often called ‘white cheese’.\nTo create traditional feta, 30 percent of goat's milk is mixed with sheep's milk of animals grazing on pastures in the specific appellation of origin regions. Nowadays, many stores sell goat and cow’s milk feta as well. The firmness, texture and flavour differ from region to region, but in general, cheese from Macedonia and Thrace is mild, softer and creamier, less salty with fewer holes. Feta made in Thessaly and Central Greece has a more intense, robust flavour. Peloponnese feta is dryer in texture, full flavoured and more open. Local environment, animal breeds, cultures all have an impact on the texture, flavour and aroma of feta.\nOn the whole, Feta is a pickled curd cheese that has a salty and tangy taste enhanced by the brine solution. The texture depends on the age which can be extremely creamy, or crumbly dry. Upon maturation of 2 months, feta is sold in blocks submerged in the brine. The cheese can be used a table cheese or melted on a traditional Greek salad, spanakopita, pizza or pie. It tastes delicious with olive oil, roasted red peppers and nuts. If required, it can be washed under water to remove the extra saltiness. The salty flavour of Feta pairs well with beer, Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc and Zinfandel."

The name Flower Marie is inspired from the Corsican sheep cheese, 'Fleur de Maquis'.  Makers of the cheese have formulated the produce suitable for vegetarians by using vegetable rennet to coagulate the milk.\nSoft in texture, the milk is sourced from a herd of Friesland-Dorset sheep. It is matured for a minimum of three weeks at the end of which the square molds develop a bloomy, pinkish rind. The paste is ivory white in colour, resembling a whipped ice cream. This aromatic cheese is mushroomy, sweet and slightly citrusy in flavour. As it ages, Flower Marie develops more intense flavours but also softens down."

The other versions are much milder than the original Fontina. There is also a Danish version which can be recognized by the red wax rind. Italian Fontina has a natural rind that turns tan to orange-brown with ageing.\nFontina Val d'Aosta is traditionally made from the unpasteurised cow's milk. The texture and flavour of the cheese depends on how long it has been aged. The texture can vary from semi-soft to firm and the flavours from mild and rich to more robust and overpowering. Usually, fontina is aged for 90 days.\nThe interior of fontina is pale cream in colour and riddled with holes known as \"eyes\". With a fat content of 45%, the cheese is very rich and creamy which gets nuttier with ageing. This versatile cheese can be used to make fondues and similar Italian dishes. Nebbiolo, red wine with wild cherry and truffles is a match for Fontina."

Here is a look at some of the truffle cheeses:\n\nTruffle Tremor – Made by Cypress Grove, California, it is a goat’s milk cheese with fragments of truffle right through the soft, creamy cheese.\n\n\nSottocenere – a semi-soft Italian cheese with flavours of licorice, nutmeg, coriander, cloves, cinnamon and fennel coated on to the rind.\nMoliterno Black Truffle Pecorino – A raw sheep’s milk Sardinian cheese covered with black truffle paste. Tastes nutty, earthy and salty, similar to a pecorino. The distinctive layers of truffles can be seen throughout the cheese.\nBoschetto al Tartufo - a semi-soft Italian cheese made with a blend of cow and sheep’s milk. Mild cheese dictated by flavours of white truffles.\n\n\nTruffle and Salt Cheddar – From the Ballard Family Dairy and Cheese in Idaho, this is an aged, pasteurised cheddar flavoured with black truffle salt.\nTruffle Gouda – Dutch Gouda sprinkled with black truffle. Tastes less sharp and sweet than other types of Gouda.\n\nThese cheeses taste delicious with condiments, for example Truffle and Porto Sauce, Black Truffle Mustard, Black Truffle Sherry Vinegar and many others."

Valais Raclette or Fromage a Raclette, as they are traditionally called, are made using ancestral methods with unpasteurised milk of cows grazing on the alpine meadows. The name Raclette comes from the French word ‘racler’, which means ‘to scrape’. The cheese has got a thin, brownish-orange coloured rind and a pale yellow pate with a few and scattered open holes. It is has a very distinctive pleasant, aromatic smell with a creamy texture, similar to Gruyere cheeses, which does not separate even when melted. The flavour can vary from nutty, slightly acidic to milky. While Switzerland supplies 80% of Raclettes, French Raclettes are slightly softer with a smooth and creamy flavour. Raclette is also the name of a Swiss dish where the cheese is melted in front of a fire or a special machine and the melted parts are scraped onto diner’s plates. It is then served with small potatoes, gherkins, pickled onions and air dried meat called Viande des Grisons. Raclette comes in round and square shapes and can be served with Vin de Savoie."

The cheese, made from the milk of once nearly extinct Old Gloucester cows, traces its origins to 1498 in the City of Gloucester.Gloucester comes in both single and double varieties. While Single Gloucester is made from skimmed milk, Double Gloucester uses full-fat milk. In addition, Double Gloucester is twice the height of Single Gloucester and more flavourful. It is also said that Double Gloucester uses the whole milk taken from two milkings or a mixture of milk and cream. On the other hand, Single Gloucester uses full cream milk from the morning milking and skimmed milk from the evening milking. Single Gloucester has a P.D.O designation, meaning it can be produced only in Gloucestershire. It is matured for a less amount of time and thus develops a fresh, somewhat nutty taste but slightly more acidic than Double. Also, it is lighter in texture, crumbly and low on fat.The double variety has a smooth and buttery texture, rich and nutty yet mellow flavour and apricot colour thanks to the addition of annatto plant extract. Vegetarian rennet is used and the cheese is aged for at least 4 months. If the cheese is allowed to age further, it will develop more complex and nutty flavours. Moreover, the texture tends to become very hard and flaky.\nDouble Gloucester participates every year in the Cooper's Hill Cheese-Rolling and Wake where buyers jump on the cheese to evaluate its quality and sustainability. A traditional British Ale or red like Syrah will perfectly complement a Double Gloucester."

It is a semi-hard cheese celebrated for its rich, unique flavour and smooth texture. The original cheese markets in Gouda is one of the last standing commercial cheese markets in the Netherlands. Since the name is not protected, it has become a generic classification for all cheeses produced and sold under the name Gouda.\nGouda is typically made from pasteurised cow’s milk although some artisan varieties use sheep’s or goat’s milk to produce cheeses that are going to be aged for a long time. Boerenkaas is a typical variety of unpasteurised Gouda cheese produced by the farmers from the milk of cow's grazing on the natural, low pastures of Netherlands. There are seven different types of Gouda cheese, categorized depending on age. Graskaas is young Gouda ready to be consumed within weeks of production. On the other hand, is the extra aged, Overjarig cheese which has a full-flavoured, hard, golden interior and salty flavour reminiscent of toffee. Between the spectrums is a variety of Dutch Gouda’s classified as per the texture and age - Jong, Jong belegen, Belegen, Extra belegen, and Oud. Each cheese gets increasingly firmer in texture and richer in flavour than earlier classification. The waxed rind of the cheese also changes by the age as soft, younger Dutch Gouda cheese are identified by yellow, orange, or red wax rinds white mature cheese have black wax coverings.\nStacked Gouda WheelsIn America, smoother and less flavourful commercial Gouda is popular than Dutch Gouda. Artisans in the Netherlands may produce Dutch Gouda using raw milk as well as pasteurised.  To enhance the flavour of the cheese, herbs, seasonings, and nuts may be blended. In the Netherlands, aged Gouda is commonly used to richen soups, sauces.\nYoung Goudas are best paired with beer while medium cheeses taste best when paired with a fruity Riesling or Chenin Blanc. A well-aged Gouda complements wines that are deeply flavoured such as a rich Merlot or Shiraz. Gouda cheese may be grated, sliced, cubed or melted. It may be used as a table cheese or dessert cheese.\nGouda is available in large wheels with each weighing between 10 and 25 pounds."

Around the world, Grana is a generic term used to define three main varieties of grana cheese—Parmigianino-Reggiano, Grana Padano and Grana Trentino and other smaller variants like Granone Lodigiano, Trentingrana and Gransardo. However, in Europe, the word “Grana” is legally protected by Grana Padano Protected Designation of Origin, such that only Grana Padano can use the term to sell its produce in EU countries.\nThe most popular Grana Italian cheeses are of course Parmigiano-Reggiano and Grana Padano. True Parmigianino-Reggiano, named after the Provinces of Parma, Reggio Emilia, Modena, Bologna and Mantua, in which it is made, has a hard, gritty texture and is fruity and nutty in taste.\nGrana Padano, on the other hand, refers to the valley Pianura Padana in which it is made. Though similar to Parmigianino-Reggiano, young Grana Padano is slightly less crumbly, milder and less complex than its famous, aged kin. On the other hand, Grana Trentino follows the same method to produce Parmigianino Reggiano but is made in the province of Trento, giving it is name.\nAll three main varieties of Grana cheese carry the label D.O.P.

Created by the Cistercian monks of Chiaravalle in the 12th century, it is still made throughout the Po River Valley in northeastern Italy.\nThe cheese is made from unpasteurised, semi-skimmed cow’s milk from two milking and generally aged for two years. At the end of the cheese making process, Grana Padano develops a firm, thick and deeply straw-coloured rind protecting the fragrant, dry, flaking interior. Grana means “grainy” in Italian which is reflected in the fine granular texture with an intensely sweet flavour. As Grana Padano ages, the flavours become pronounced, savory and complex and the texture becomes more crumbly.\nThough similar to Parmigiano Reggiano Grana Padano is inexpensive because areas producing the cheese are bigger. Moreover, Grana is less crumbly, milder and less complex than its long-aged sibling.\nGrana Padano is manufactured in cylindrical wheels measuring 35 to 45 cm in diameter, and 15 to 18 cm in height. It is sold at different ripening stages: Grana Padano (9 to 16 months), Grana Padano oltre 16 mesi (over 16 months) and Grana Padano Riserva (over 20 months).\nTry pairing the cheese with a Barolo, Zinfandel or Gavi white wine."

   "Description": "Originating in the French region of Val-de-Marne, Grand Vatel is a popular triple-cream cheese made from cow's milk. Grand Vatel is also known as Boursault and Délice de Saint-Cyr. The cheese invented in 1953 by Henri Boursault has a very high fat content which lends it a melt-in-the-mouth, creamy soft consistency. With fat percent tipping the scales at nearly 75%, the ultra rich buttery taste and very creamy texture of Grand Vatel makes it a favorite dessert cheese. The cheese has a thin, bloomy rind due to a coating of light penicillin mold. Aging of Grand Vatel takes about two months with one more month in packaging. As the cheese ages, it acquires a mushroomy and a refreshing citrusy taste. The cheese sold in small cylinder shaped rounds should be consumed within a week of purchase. Try pairing this cheese with grapes or pears and light, fruity wines like Vouvray."

The company follows a special procedure to produce their cheese, which involves maturing it in caves for a minimum of 6 months. In addition, they make sure the cheese making process starts in mid-April when the grasses feed the cows better and the milk supply is sufficient. Havilah is a dense cheese with a beautiful, earthy black rind made from a layer of ash beneath which lies a dense, yellowish pate. Slightly pungent, this mouth-watering dense cheese reveals fruity tones of pineapple, citrus, and caramel. It is perfect for grating or meting on dishes such as pastas or crisps. If Havilah is aged beyond 16 months, it begins to develop granules giving the cheese a wonderful texture."

Since the cheese is not aged, the texture remains soft and it spoils very fast. These days it is very rare to find the cheese commercially because of its neutral taste and short-lived shelf life. It is available in small grocery shops, gas stations and restaurants in the south of the United States where the farmer or grocer sells the cheese fresh off the wheel.Hoop cheese is a mild, slightly salty cheese with a rubbery texture when young which becomes sharp and crumbly if allowed to age. The colour of the pate is rich yellow with a subtle nutty flavour.

Traditional, Swedish Hushållsost is mild, creamy and brings out flavours of clear salt and fresh acidity. It has a pale, straw-coloured interior with a smooth, open texture and small irregular holes. The low-fat version has a slightly buttery and nutty taste.\nUse the most popular cheese in Sweden in casseroles, sandwiches and pizza or add it to highlight any buffet or cheese platter.

   "Description": "Idiazabal (also known as Idiazabel / Queso Idiazabal La Vasco Navarra) is a traditional, farmhouse, hard cheese made from raw milk of Latxa or Carranza sheep in the Basque and Navarra regions of northern Spain. Named after the village of Idiazabal, the cheese received Spanish D.O. (Denominacion de Origen) in 1987. In summer, the sheep migrate to higher pastures to graze on the blossoming, new grass. During this time, the artisanal cheese makers milk the sheep, make the cheese and leave it in the rafters to mature for a minimum ripening of 2 months. At the end of summer when the cheese makers return back to the lowlands with their sheep, the cheese has ripened and is ready for sale.Idiazabal is produced in the shape of a cylinder, with a smooth and hard natural rind that is pale yellow to amber in colour. The cheese has a compact texture, with a few pinprick holes. It is dry, but not crumbly, and feels pleasantly oily in the mouth. The rind carries the marks of the wooden moulds in which it was drained. The characteristic, smoky flavour is the result of the cheeses having been stored near the fireplaces. There were no chimneys in the simple mountain huts, so the cheeses absorbed the sweet, aromatic smoke. The taste of the cheese is reminiscent of burnt caramel and bacon. It is also available in natural flavour.  It pairs well with red wine and cider.PDO Idiazabal smoked cheese has won a Super Gold medal at the 2014 World Cheese Awards. It is declared one of the world's 62 best cheeses. "

Among all its synonyms, leipäjuusto is the more commonly known name.\nLeipäjuusto is a fresh cheese made from cow's beestings, rich milk from a cow that has recently calved. It can be made also from reindeer or even goat's milk. The cheese is 'toasted' during its preparation and it contains about 20 to 22% fat while today's lighter versions contain about 12% fat.\nTraditionally, people used to let leipäjuusto get totally dried so that they could then store it for up to several years. For eating, they used to heat the almost rock hard Leipäjuusto cheese on a fire to soften it and to produce appetizing aroma. Even today, the cheese is dried by keeping it in a well ventilated area for a few days. But, unlike its older version, it has a mild flavour."

It is about the hallmark black-brown patina that develops as the cheese matures for 3 months in the cheese dairy and for more than 300 days in the sandstone caves of Kaltbach. During this maturation process, white crystals and drops of water are formed from the cheese, known as \"tears of joy\". These \"tears of joy\" are a sign of quality in the cheese. The cave maturation results in a tangly nutty flavour and crumbly texture, typical of the fine Swiss classic from the caves. This genuine classic tastes delicious with dried apricots, caramelized onions, bacon, cheese plates, panini, casseroles, gratins. Try pairing the cheese with drinks such as Chardonnay, Zinfandel, Syrah, black tea for a great combination.Kaltbach Emmentaler has won many international awards including bronze and gold at the 2014 World Cheese Awards."

Dutch cheeses similar to Kanterkaas but without the PDO label are known as Friese nagelkaas or simply nagelkaas. Kanter is Dutch for 'edge' referring to the angular shape of the cheese, with a sharp transition from the side to the bottom of the cheese.\nKanterkaas is available in two varieties Kanterkomijnekaas, which is flavoured with cumin and Kanternagelkaas laced with cumin and cloves. It is a hard cheese made with two types of fats, respectively: 20+ (20-25%) and 40+ (40-44%). The colour of the rind is natural or may be treated with a colourless or yellow-coloured, or red coloured cheese rind coating agent.\nThe flavour of Kanterkaas changes immensely as it ages. Plain Kanterkaas is nice and spicy to tangy, depending on age. Kanterkomijnekaas tastes fragrant, spicy, pleasant and mild to strong.\nKanternagelkaas flavour varies from fragrant, spicy, warm and spicy to tangy. The pate of the cheese is firm to hard. The colour of Kanter cheese is evenly ivory or yellow to yellow-green. It has a closed body, but some holes may exist. The cloves and cumin are evenly spread throughout the pate."

This cheese is also found in Hungary, Croatia, and Turkey. The Romanians call this cheese cascaval, the Greeks kasseri while the Turkish prefer to interpret it as Ksara.\n\nThis semi-hard cheese is allowed to age for six months during which it develops a piquant, spicy and somewhat salty taste with a slight hint of olive oil. Due to its similarity in taste with the United Kingdom's cheddar cheese, it is famously called \"cheddar cheese of the Balkans\". Kashkaval belongs to the family of pasta filata cheeses that are made by giving the curd a hot bath during the production process.\nThe slightly hard texture of this yellow table cheese makes it suitable for grilling and grating. It can be served as a cheese platter or used in salads, appetizers, pizzas, and lasagna."

To obtain the correct texture and flavour, the cheese needs to be matured for a minimum of four months. It is used as a substitute for the famous mozzarella by many Americans.\nThis white crust cheese also competes against another famous Greek cheese, Feta. Kasseri is preferred by connoisseurs who like full-flavoured cheeses. A bite of Kasseri will enrich your palate with exciting salty flavours and pungent odour. But interestingly, it soon leaves behind a sweet aftertaste, which is because of the usage of sheep milk.\nPale yellow in colour, Kasseri’s mild, palatable, buttery taste makes it an excellent table cheese. The fat content is between 25% - 45%. It goes well with omelettes, sandwiches."

The procedure of making Labneh is same as strained yoghurt, that of boiling off some of the water content, adding salt, butterfat and powdered milk. Eaten both cooked and raw, it is used in savoury sauces as it does not curdle at high temperatures, unlike normal yoghurt, due to its high fat content. It is used as dip for bread, added to stew, and to add creaminess to soups. Also used as a sandwich spread. The cheese has to be consumed within a week of its preparation. Nowadays this cheese is also available in low fat variety."

But production reached its peak at the beginning of 20th century, when the monks transferred the recipe to the 'buronniers'. It has been protected by the AOC seal since 1961. Affinage takes at least four months and the temperature of affinage and conservation must be below 140C.Laguiole has a thick, greyish-orange and natural rind beneath which lies a straw-coloured supple and firm pate. The rich and creamy texture of the pate right away melts away in the mouth unveiling a sharp and yet slightly sour flavour.

   "Description": "Laruns, a region of France located in the Southwest part of Pyrenees Mountains is home to numerous artisanal cheesemakers who primarily produce cheese from ewe’s milk. However, locals also produce versions of cheese from cow’s and goat’s milk.\nOne such cheese made from unpasteurised ewe’s milk is semi-cooked and pressed, sculpted in the shape of flattened round loaf. It is packaged in a cylinder weighing 5 to 6 kilograms and measuring 30 cm in diameter and 9 cm thick.\nThe crust of this cheese is smooth, straw coloured while the paste is supple dough. At 6 months of ripening, the texture of the cheese becomes hard and brittle. When young, the cheese has a sweet, smoky, mild and nutty taste which becomes pronounced and intense with age. The affinage of six months gives the cheese a balanced blend of acidity, salt and fat. It is used as a table cheese, but when aged, it is also good for cooking."

Since the name is protected in Spain, an authentic Queso de La Serena is recognizable by the fire branding on top lid.The cheese is made from raw full cream milk and vegetable rennet obtained from pistils of artichoke thistle. Once matured for at least 60 days, it displays a waxy yellow rind and the imprints of esparto grass in which it is molded. The flavour graph varies according to its age, ranging from buttery when it is young and bitter when it is mature. During maturing, the cheese turns into deliciously runny and almost liquidy paste. A fully matured La Serena has a creamy consistency that can be scooped out after cutting out the circular lid. The intense bitter yet pleasant flavour tastes best with bread or toast. "

The cheese is popularly known for its stinky aroma which has been compared to foot odour. Today, most of the cheese is exclusively made in Germany, making them the sole producers in Europe.\nArtisanal cheese makers prepare this cheese from pasteurised cow’s milk sourced from local, organic farms. As a result, the flavour of the cheese is mild despite the stinky aroma.\nThe exterior of the cheese is covered with a thin pale, orange-brown rind, an effect of regular washings.\nIn the initial month of ripening, Limburger is firmer and more crumbly but starts to become chalky and soft at the end of six weeks. After two months, the cheese is much smoother and creamy. At three months, Limburger finally acquires the infamous aroma due to smear-ripening with solutions of bacteria.\nThe interior is a soft and yielding, straw-coloured pate that becomes funnier with age. This cheese has a significant grassy and mushroomy taste underlined by a delicate tang at the end.\nLimburger goes well with Belgian style ales and icy cold bock beer. It tastes best when it is served between two slices of dark rye bread along with a slice of onion."

It is a slow-maturing cheese that takes between 12-24 months to develop a golden, straw-coloured yellow pate and spotted brown and grey colour rind. One gets daily, and seasonal variation in terms of both flavour and texture but all-in-all the cheese has both cheddar and gruyere-like qualities. It has a smooth texture and a strong taste. In summer, notes of pineapple, toasted nuts and grassy dominate the flavour profile while in winter, the taste becomes savoury and almost meaty. Lincolnshire Poacher pairs well with full-bodied reds and whites and beer.\nThe company makes many other traditional kinds of cheese such as Vintage Lincolnshire Poacher aged for 18 to 22 months, Smoked Lincolnshire Poacher, Double Barrel, and Lincolnshire Red, made using vegetarian rennet."

The cheese was created in the early 1990s as an alternative to more expensive Swiss Emmental cheese. It is a high-fat cheese with a minimum of 45% fat. Although similar to Emmental, the moisture content in Maasdam is more, making it suppler. Nearly 15% of Dutch cheese production is made up of Maasdam.\nIt ripens faster than other Dutch cheeses, being ready in four to 12 weeks. The outside shell of the cheese has smooth, waxed yellow or naturally polished rind similar to Gouda. Inside the pate is a semi-firm, pale yellow with big eyes. It has a creamy texture and a sweet, buttery, nutty taste with a fruity background. If eaten young, it tastes delectable with a sandwich or as a snack. Satiate your taste buds by melting the cheese on casseroles, soups or fondues.\nMaasdam cheese has all of the traits of Leerdammer cheese except for the brand name, which resides exclusively with Le Groupe Bel. It pairs well with White Zinfandel, Lager, Pale Ale, Gewurztraminer, Chardonnay, Merlot, Sauvignon Blanc and Chianti."

It is also said that the cheese has been created in the 10th century by a monk, Maroilles in northern France.\nWhile preparing Maroilles, the industrialized version uses pasteurised milk as opposed to the artisan cheese which is still depends on raw milk. It usually has a square shape with brick-red, smooth, washed and sticky rind. When young, the cheese is called “Maroille Blanc” because the cheese has still not developed the distinctive brick red rind and characteristic flavour.\nIt is matured from five weeks to four months during which it is regularly washed with salt and water. If eaten young, the cheese is still chalky in the center and has a bitter rind. As it ages and with the washing process, the rind changes its colour from yellow to orange and finally red.\nAt four months, the ivory pâte is soft and oily. It has a powerful, pungent aroma suggestive of fermenting fruit and the flavour reminds of smoky bacon. Earthy notes of walnuts and mushrooms contrasted by a strong, pungent aroma are very typical of an aged Maroilles. This cheese is produced in various sizes and the content of fat is about 29 per cent."

Making the cheese is so simple that many people easily make their own Mascarpone at home.\nMascarpone is used in both sweet and savory dishes. It is added to enhance the flavour of the dish without overwhelming the original taste. The cheese tastes best with anchovies, mustard and spices, or mixed with cocoa or coffee.

Another possible use of Mascarpone is to thicken puddings and dessert creams. It is also popular as a standalone dessert served with fruit or syrup.\nWhether you buy Mascarpone or make it at home, it needs to be consumed within a few days or it can go bad. "

At the end of its ripening period, the cheese develops its characteristic deep blue veins.Meredith Blue is creamy and mild and the sheep's milk gives the cheese its characteristic sweet taste. It is one of the rare blue cheeses, which requires intense, delicate and complicated cheesemaking procedure. Meredith Blue will last well in a cool and dry place for about 3 weeks. It is used in diverse techniques right from sauces, main courses to desserts and in crumbled form on salads. It pairs well with sweet and red wines, Ales and Pilsners."

It is a soft, wet cheese made from raw cow milk and can be ripened or unripened depending on its variation. The tradition of making Minas cheese is more than 300 years old. In May 2008, the original firm, ripened Minas cheese was declared a Brazilian Immaterial Cultural Heritage by IPHAN, the Brazilian Immaterial Cultural Heritage by IPHAN, the Brazilian Institute for National Historic and Artistic Heritage.\nThe time left to ripen Minas cheese can vary from as little as 4 -10 days, which results in queijos-de-minas frescal cheese. It has a spongy texture, with lots of air bubbles inside with a mild yet quite salty taste. The saltiness will vary according to the region and producer. This is not a good cooking cheese but can be used to make sandwiches, pastries and crêpes. The texture tends to become slightly rubbery rather than stringy with heat. It pairs well with turkey breast and other low fat cold cuts, cooked strong-tasting vegetables and salads.\nIf left to mature for around 1-5 weeks, the soft unripened variety develops into partly-cured Minas cheese (queijo minas meia-cura). The fully-cured variety of Minas cheese called queijo minas curado is ready when juicy softness has evaporated and it acquires a yellowish tint. Curado cheese has a white core, pricked with tiny bubbles of air, slightly more granulated than frescal and with a more stronger taste, deviating to bitter. It is excellent for cooking, being used in a huge variety of dishes, particularly the famous pão de queijo (cheese bun). One of the most popular desserts in Brazil is a sweet dish called goiabada prepared with Minas cheese and guavas. A branded, supermarket variety called Queijo Padrao is also popular across Brazil. It is similar to frescal, except that it is less soft, juicy and salty than the original."

Since most of them raised their own cattle of cows, goats and sheep, cheese was the obvious natural bi-product. Today, very less monasteries actually make traditional monastic cheeses as a majority of them are now manufactured by companies unrelated to the monks. These handmade cheeses made at the hands of a religious order or mere its imitation are known as monastery, trappist or monk cheeses.\nMonastic cheeses are typically made in Belgium, France and Switzerland. But they are also made at monasteries in Canada and the US. Most of them, though not always, were a soft or semi-soft cow's milk cheese washed or rubbed with brine or alcohol. The flavours are pungent, whereas the factory imitations tend to be quite mild and bland. Some monasteries these days have started making cheeses in other varieties such as gouda, cheddar, smoked cheese, blue cheese and flavoured cheese.  "

Also known as Schachtelkase, the cheese has been produced since the early 19th century and contains an authentic rural flavour of the region. Usually, it is made using pasteurised cow´s milk, but there have been produces of Mondseer made from goat’s milk as well. Texturally smooth with narrow eyes, the cheese is typically piquant and slightly acidic taste due to the infusion of salt water and red cultures. The taste of the cheese is close to Munster or Limburger despite its relative hardness. Each round of rich, buttery and creamy Mondseer weighs around twenty to thirty pounds. It is a very popular cheese in Austrian cuisine specially used in cheese salads, Brett´ljausen, heavy cheese platters and au gratin dishes."

The cheese became popular by the name “Monterey Jack's” or “Jack's Monterey,” eventually acquiring the name Monterey Jack.\nThe cheese is commonly used in Mexican and Spanish cuisine because it is mild in flavour and melts really well. It is similar in taste and texture to Colby and Cheddar. Variants of Monterey Jack known as Dry Jack (aged version) and Pepper Jack (pepper spiced) are also quite popular. Monterey Jack is available across all grocery stores and supermarkets in the United States. Consider Pinot Noir and Riesling with this cheese."

   "Description": "Buffalo mozzarella (Mozzarella di Bufala) is a cheese made from the milk of domestic water buffalo. It has been observed that the cheeses made from buffalo milk are higher in calcium, protein and lower in cholesterol than cow's milk. The cheese is manufactured under strict regulations in areas ranging from Rome in Lazio to Paestum, Campania and a production area near Foggia, Puglia. Buffalo mozzarella from the Campania region bears the \"Mozzarella di Bufala Campana\" trademark and DOC status granted in 1993. In 2008, the European Union granted Mozzarella di Bufala Campana a Protected Geographical Status. Apart from Italy, it is also produced in many countries.\nBuffalo mozzarella is a fresh, soft, semi-elastic textured cheese belonging to the \"pasta filata\" family. The process of making pasta filata cheese includes heating the curd to a point where it can be stretched and formed into various shapes. This gives the snowy white mozzarella a mild yet slightly sour taste. The texture is soft, moist and somewhat granular. It is coated with a thin edible rind and brined for up to a week when sold in vacuum-sealed packages.\nThe cheese goes well in antipasti dishes, salads, pastas, calzones, vegetables and various side dishes. It is also common in popular Italian dishes like lasagne and baked casserole. When used in cooking, heated mozzarella becomes slightly creamy. Buffalo mozzarella pairs with Beaujolais, Sauvignon Blanc and White.  "

The soft and creamy cheese also comes flavoured with cumin and tastes best when accompanied with a good beer. As with washed rind cheeses, Munster have a red coating on the rind that is slightly humid due to repeated washings. Other than protecting the cheese, the rind is also responsible for a strong, penetrating aroma and tangy taste.\nThe best Munster cheeses are produced in the summer and autumn when the cows graze on the 'high stubble' of the Vosges. This cheese has a very high fat content of 45-50%. Gewurztraminer or full-bodied red wines nicely complement Munster. If you're a potato and cheese lover try Munster with potatoes, salad and finely chopped onions."

The cheese is surface-ripened for more than 6 weeks during which it develops flavours of fresh mushrooms, nuts and milk and a very slightly acidic aroma. As the cheese ripens, these flavours intensify and become more robust.  When young, Noyan is not too strong and can be used to add flavour to many types of sauces. As it matures, its enhanced flavours add quite bit of zing to quiches, soups and au gratin dishes. It also pairs deliciously with crusty bread or crackers and fruits such as apple or grapes."

These monks continued to make the cheese until the dissolution of their monasteries in 1540. Traditionally, sheep’s milk was used, but over the time cow’s milk was also used. The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer’s wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow’s milk with sheep’s milk added to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wenslydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire.\nOak Smoked Wensleydale is naturally smoked for 18 hours using oak chips at the Wensleydale Creamery dairy to generate a subtle, smoked flavour along with a firmer and stronger texture. The cheese is a variant of Real Yorkshire Wensleydale as it maintains the same characteristics while adopting an attractive golden beech colour.\nWensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of cheeseboard where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavours rule the roost. It complements fruity white wine such as Pinot Grigio."

Beneath the brown and orange rind is an ivory white, supple and slightly grainy interior that has a creamy and buttery mouth feel. Flavours are herbaceous, nutty and fruity if the produce is from winter while the summer cheeses tend to reveal aromas of grass and flowers.\nMatured for at least 6 months, Ossau-Iraty often comes in a flat cylindrical shape. There are three main sizes available, small (Petit-Ossau-Iraty-Brebis Pyrenes), intermediate (non-fermier) and large (fermier). It is sometimes dusted with paprika leaves to add a kick of flavour.

   "Description": "The Pallone di Gravina is made from cow’s milk, and is firm in texture. The cheese comes from the regions of Basilicata and Apulia in southeast Italy and dates back to the days when the livestock was migrated from place to place.\nThe term ‘Pallone’ comes from the word ‘palla’, the round ball-like shape of the cheese, which makes it easier to hang them in caves or transport over the backs of the donkeys during the livestock migration or the transhumance. The cheese is made in the style of pasta filata, and generally weights between 1.5 and 2.5 kg. It is shaped like a balloon, and was traditionally created in the city of Gravina, in the province of Bari. However, in the recent times the cheese is produced only in the regions of the province of Matera.\nThe rind of the cheese is straw-coloured, smooth and hard. It becomes browner as it ages, and turns golden when the cheese gets fully matured. It needs to be aged for at least twelve months before it reaches maturity. The process of making this cheese starts with warming and curdling with rennet and then they are placed in a tompagno, which is a perforated basket. After some hours the sets are sliced up and ‘spun’ in hot water. The portions of cheese are then moulded manually, and after salting in brine for 12 to 20 hours, they are allowed to dry. \nIn 2009 the comune of Gravina made an application for the cheese to receive PDO status within the European Union. "

The remaining three mature PDO cheese are Pecorino Sardo from Sardinia, Pecorino Siciliano from Sicily and Pecorino Toscano from Tuscany.\nPecorinos are traditional, creamery, hard, drum-shaped cheese. They come in a variety of flavours depending on ageing period. Aged Pecorinos referred to as 'Stagionato' are hard and crumbly in texture with buttery and nutty flavours. Young or 'Semi-Stagionato' and 'Fresco' Pecorinos feature a softer texture with mild, creamy flavours. A good Pecorino will have a smooth, hard rind which is pale straw to dark brown in colour. The rind will vary in colour, depending on the age of the cheese, and may include a protecting coating of lard or oil. Its compact interior is white to pale yellow in colour, with irregular, small eyes.\nToday, these classic Italian Pecorinos are available in many flavours including Pecorino Pepato spiced with black peppercorns or red chilli. Pecorino is a preferred cheese in many pastas and an obvious choice in Italian regions where the cheese is produced. Also, it served as a good substitute for the expensive Parmigiano-Reggiano."

   "Description": "Pecorino is a term used to define Italian cheese made from 100% sheep’s milk. However, the American counterpart of the cheese is made from cow’s milk. Of the four Pecorino kinds of cheese that have received Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) status under European Union law, Pecorino Romano is one of the most ancient types of cheese as well as the most famous outside of Italy. As per legislation, production of Pecorino Romano is allowed only on the islands of Sardinia, Lazio and in the Tuscan Province of Grosseto. All these varieties differ from each other, depending on their ageing period. \nAs the name suggests, the history of Pecorino Romano dates back to Roman times when it was a part of the staple diet of soldiers at war. Roman authors, including Varro, Pliny the Elder, Hippocrates and Columella have mentioned about cheese & its production technique, in their works. Even today, the cheese is made using the traditional method. The wheels get salted numerous times by hand, to deliver a fabulous taste. Its lengthy ageing time from 8 to 12 months results in a dry and granular texture and a strong taste. When young, the cheese has a soft and rubbery texture with a sweet and aromatic flavour. The flavour becomes sharper and smokier when aged for more than 8 months.\n\nPecorino Romano is one of the most widely used, sharper alternatives to Parmesan cheeses. Pecorino Romano is an excellent grating cheese over pasta dishes, breads and baking casseroles. Pair it with a glass of big, bold Italian red wine or a light beer.\n"

It was the idea of a Swiss employee at the dairy who suggested that adding cream to the curd will enrich the flavour of the cheese.\nPetit-Suisse is a fresh cheese – unripened, unsalty, smooth and creamy. Its texture is more comparable to a thick yogurt than a cheese. Made from cow’s milk, it is enriched with cream so that it contains at least 40% fat content.\nThe 30g version of the cheese is called Petit-Suisse while larger packagings are referred to as a double Suisse, double petit-suisse or suisse double.\nPetit-Suisse has a mixture of sweet and sour flavour, and it tastes delicious with jam, fruit, honey and nuts. It is sometimes salted and peppered with herbs. This cheese is also used as a base for several traditional French desserts."

Pizy is made in the style of Tomme Vaudoise, a cheese local to Fabienne’s hometown.This soft farm cheese has a smooth, melt-in-your-mouth creamy white paste that becomes increasingly runny over time. Flavours are mild, milky with notes of salted butter and a hint of bitterness, resulting from prolonged ripening.Serve Pizy on a cheese platter seasoned with pepper and cumin. It is also a good choice for breakfast or as a side dish. Pair aromatic and mellow white wine or Sparkling rose with Pizy to enhance its flavour.\nThis is an award-winning cheese having won the Prix de l'École de laiterie award at the 2014 Sélection CASEUS competition."

   "Description": "Pleasant Creek is a goat's milk cheese made by Pholia Farm Creamery and Dairy. It is aged for 7-9 months in the Pholia caves during the winter months. The naturally present red moulds in the caves give the cheese a reddish rind, thus making it a thermophilic, cave-aged cheese. It is suitable for vegetarians as it is set with vegetarian, non-GMO rennet. The yellow interior is smooth, moderately eyed with mild, buttery and nutty flavours and grassy and fruity notes. The cheese is named after a tributary to Evans Creek that flows near the farm."

   "Description": "Mike Gingrich in the southwestern green hills of Wisconsin produces Pleasant Ridge Reserve. Modelled on the likes of Gruyere and Beaufort, this cheese is made from unpasteurised cow's milk. Similar to all other Alpine cheeses, Uplands make this cheese only from May through October when the cows graze on fresh pasture. Pleasant Ridge Reserve offers a creamy, nutty, and deeply flavoured milky finish that comes from the use of grass-fed milk. The texture is semi-firm and its dense taste becomes more delightful with dry Champagnes and fine Chardonnays. As the cheese ages, the handcrafted cheese becomes more complex and concentrated. A small batch of the cheese is aged for over a year and sold as \"Extra Aged\" only in the fall and early winter. Pleasant Ridge Reserve is America's most-awarded cheese having won major, national cheese competitions."

Provel has retained its popularity in St. Louis and is often manufactured and sold in and around this area.Provel is either available in loaf form or rope form."

   "Description": "A whole cow's milk cheese with semi-hard texture, Provoleta is an Argentinean variant of Provolone cheese, usually served as an appetizer or barbecued in its home country and Uruguay as well. Natalio Alba is said to have invented this cheese after he sensed Italian-Argentinean food habits which required a cheese accompaniment with a roast. The cheese was first made in 1940 with great efforts as it called for a produce that should not melt while grilling yet the inside should be melted a little. However, it was trademarked in 1963.\nIt is a South American tradition to eat a small disc of Provoleta with asado before having the grilled meat. But given that it is so tasty, it could work as a beautiful starter with any al fresco meal. It tends to keep its shape and develops a nice smokey flavour when grilled. The cheese is seasoned with a popular mix of spices and herb oil called Chimichurri and is generally served with toasted or crusty bread. It is best had with a Argentinean wine such as Malbec."

Today, the major production of Provolone takes place in the Po valley region, particularly Lombardy and Veneto. Both Provolone Valpadana and Provolone del Monaco are granted DOP designation by the European Union to ensure that cheese is produced under strict supervision using specific methods to guarantee supreme quality.\nProvolone cheese is also classified into two forms: Provolone Dolce, aged 2-3 months, has a pale yellow to white colour and sweet taste. The other, Provolone Piccante, is aged for more than four months and has a sharper taste. In South America, a similar cheese by the name of Provoleta is eaten with grilled meat. In America, Provolone produced is similar to the Dolce variety. The flavours of Provolone largely vary depending on where it’s made. Mostly, it’s semi-hard in texture and made from cow’s milk.\n\nProvolone contains high amounts of calcium and protein, but on the other hand, it is also high in sodium. The cheese goes along with full-bodied and aged red wines. At the table, it could be served with hot chutney, homemade bread and flatbread.\n"

Both Provolone Valpadana and Provolone del Monaco are granted DOP designation by the European Union to ensure that cheese is produced under strict supervision using specific methods to guarantee supreme quality.\nProvolone del Monaco is a semi-hard, kneaded-curd, matured cheese produced from the raw milk of cows reared within the province of Naples. For the product to maintain the consistent quality it follows certain procedures and criteria. Twenty percent of the milk comes from Agerolese cows to give Provolone del Monaco its unique flavour. The cheese should be matured for a minimum of 180 days, at the end of which the product should weigh 2.5 kg but not more than 8 kg. The pear-shaped body of the Provolone tied with raffia is cream coloured, elastic, compact and has characteristic eye holes which may increase towards the centre of the cheese. It has a high-fat content of 40.5%. Thanks to the stringent guidelines and intricate processing, the cheese turns out to be extremely flavourful with sweet, buttery aroma with a light, pleasantly spicy taste. With an extended maturation period, the taste and aroma of the cheese become more robust and spicier.\nThe ripe flavour of the cheese goes along with full-bodied and aged red wines.

Its texture is similar to that of cream cheese, pot cheese or ricotta with a fat content ranging from low to medium. Quark is usually sold in plastic tubs with most or all of the whey. The flavour is reminiscent of sour cream with the seasonings of herbs, spices or fruits.

It is soft, white, chalky with a crumbly, slightly lumpy texture that softens as the cheese ripens. The colour of the pate is white to pale straw, which changes upon ripening. The thin and soft rind is pinkish white when young, turns to reddish grey-green after maturation. Quartirolo Lombardo is ripened between 5 to 30 days for soft PDO Quartirolo Lombardo and more than 30 days for Ripe PDO Quartirolo Lombardo. The taste is distinctive, slightly sour and aromatic in the fresh cheeses, which intensifies as the cheese ages. The delicate and fragrant flavour of the younger cheese becomes stronger and typically aromatic upon ripening.Quartirolo Lombardo is a typical table cheese that goes well with salads, cold dishes, fruits, walnuts and honey.

It is one of the oldest cheeses in Sicily with evidence dating as early as 1500.  Originally known by the name of Caciocavallo, it lost its historical name after it acquired the recognition of PDO. A hard cheese from the pasta filata family, Ragusano is made with whole milk from the Modicana breed of cows fed on fresh grass or hay. When milk from other cow breeds is used, due to the scarcity of Modicana breed, the cheese is called “Cosacavaddu Rausanu”.\nThe cheese is sold at different stages of ageing in rectangular blocks. When it is fresh within two months of production, the cheese tastes sweet, pleasant and delicate. Cheeses ripened beyond six months tend to become more flavourful and spicier with age. The rind is smooth, thin and exhibits a yellowish-golden colour that deepens as the cheese ages. Ragusano, smoked using natural processes, is also available and here, the designation stamp will have the word “affumicato” attached to the name of the cheese. A compact cheese with straw-coloured pate, Ragusano goes well with full-bodied red wines and aged dark beers."

The cheese was decreed as an A.O.C. cheese in 1958 and therefore is subject follow to strict rules and regulations. It is a lightly pressed, uncooked cheese, made from full-cream unpasteurised milk. Thirteenth century fables tell of Savoie herdsmen who carried out an incomplete milking of the cows in order to reduce their ‘taxable’ production of milk. After the rent was paid to the landowners, they went back to ‘remilk' (reblocher) the cows. The second milking of cows yielded a milk rich in fat and was used to make Reblochon.\n\nCreative Commons/ZubroReblochon features a fine velvety rind, varying from yellow to orange in colour. The close textured pate is very smooth, supple and ivory in colour. Farmhouse cheese discs are matured for at least two weeks, during which the cheese develops an edible light beige crust and buttery dough. Reblochon has a slight scent of the cellar and a mild fruity taste with an intense nutty aftertaste. Its delicate and subtle flavours go well with a glass of Savoie wine. The cheese is excellent on the cheeseboard or can be melted on baked potatoes. Reblochon also features as a classic ingredient in one of the Alps' best-loved dishes, the Tartiflette.\n This celebrated cheese recently won Bronze medal at 2014 World Cheese Awards.\n"

   "Description": "Red Leicester, formerly known as Leicester or Leicestershire cheese is a traditional hard English cheese made from unpasteurised cow’s milk. The history of the cheese dates back to the 17th century when farmers recognized the need to make and look their cheeses apart from cheese made in other parts of the country. They decided that the colour of the cheese should denote its richness and creaminess. To set it apart from cheddar and highlight the quality of cheese, Leicester is coloured with a vegetable dye called annatto. The rind is reddish-orange with a powdery mould on it. The colour indicates that the milk used has a high cream content. Today, only a a couple of farms in Leicestershire makes the cheese using traditional methods and raw milk.\nRed Leicester is a hard cheese, similar to Cheddar but much more moist, crumblier with a milder flavour. It matures faster than cheddar and can be sold as young as two months. A good Leicester cheese can be identified by a firm body and a close, flaky texture. Though the cheese can be consumed young, to reach it's optimum flavour, it should be allowed to mature for six to nine months. A good cheese tastes slightly sweet with an almost caramel flavour and builds up a more robust taste as it ages. The cheese suits a full-bodied white wine such as Muscadet, SancerreChenin Blanc and Vouvray."

The word is probably derived from the French town of Condrieu, some 40 kilometres south of Lyon.\nThough Rigotte sounds similar to Ricotta, it is not produced by recooking the milky whey. In the 1930s, the farmers had to dilute goat’s milk with cow’s to produce the cheese due to the scarcity of goatherds. But, today, they have returned to their roots and produce this rare cheese purely from goat's milk.\nRigotte can be eaten fresh but the actual flavours develop on maturity. The pate will become slightly moist and the rind nearly dry and finely wrinkled. A nutty, delicate flavour of honey and acacia will leave a wonderful taste in the mouth.\nIt goes with Condrieu, red wines like Cornas and maybe a white St. Joseph."

Determined by the type of milk used, name of Romano cheeses may be preceded by the word Vaccino (cow’s milk), Pecorino (sheep’s milk) or Caprino (goat’s milk). The most famous example of Romano cheese is Pecorino Romano, an exclusive Italian cheese with DOP designation from the Italian government.  \nOne of the most popular Italian cheeses, Romano cheese is made from pasteurised or unpasteurised milk using animal, plant, or microbial rennet. It has a grainy texture, a hard and brittle rind and grates easily. The curing of Romano takes not less than 5 months and longer if it is planned for grating.\nEvery Romano cheese has its own peculiarities and shows different shades in texture, flavour and cooking uses. While Pecorino Romano, made from sheep’s milk, is sharp and quite tangy the second type of Romano cheese, Caprino Romano made from goat’s milk has an extremely sharp taste. The third variety made from cow’s milk, Vacchino Romano, is very mild in flavour.\nRomano cheese works excellent as a table cheese. It can be grated over pasta, soups and salad or shaved onto cooked dishes and cream sauces. Hard cheeses like Romano best pair with fruity wines like Riesling and Prosecco.\n "

As it matures, the cheese starts turning firmer."

The taste, rind and texture are creamy, delicate and soft due to the use of soft curd in the cheesemaking process. In fact, the cheese is sometimes sold in a small ceramic or terra cotta pot since the pate can almost become runny. The optimal flavour of this creamy, buttery and nutty cheese occurs between April and September. Cheese aficionados adore Saint Félicien with a chilled Sancerre or Pouilly Fume.

   "Description": "São Jorge is a cheese from an island of the same name, located 900 miles from the west coast of Portugal and part of Azores archipelago. Made from raw cow’s milk, São Jorge is a robust, aged cheese ripened for between three and seven months before being sold in the market. Although the cheese is made by three dairies on the island, only one has received the special DOP status. The DOP cheese is matured for a minimum of 90 days but the wheels can be sold at different ages; three, four or seven months.\nSão Jorge has a firm, slightly waxy texture that envelops an open, straw-coloured paste. Flavours are mild, full and buttery with tangy, spicy undernotes."

   "Description": "Schabziger, sold under the name sapsago in the United States, is a traditional Swiss cheese produced in the Canton of Glarus in Switzerland. Records suggest the cheese was made by the monks of Glarus since the 8th century. But its recipe was formally protected on 24th April 1463 at the Glarner Landsgemeinde, when it was decided that in order for the cheese to be called Schabziger, it had to be marked with a stamp. This makes it one of the oldest protected cheeses in the world.The cheese is produced from skimmed cow’s milk with addition of blue fenugreek, a type of clover which gives the cheese a pale lime colour. It is an extremely expensive herb brought to Europe in ancient times from the Middle East. At the last stages of production, Schabziger is molded into distinctive conical shapes and then wrapped in silver foil, ready to be sold.Texturally, the cheese is dry, hard and aged while flavour wise it is pungent, spicy and delicious. If a milder taste is required, the cheese is mixed with butter to make a spread called Zigerbutter. The cheese is used in cooking as a condiment or as a dipping similar to the Dukkah. It is also grated over food or the butter-mix paste is spread over bread or crackers. The cheese is high in protein and almost fat-free."

As it ripens, Sardo turns dry, crumbly and apt for grating.

Since 2002, it has been awarded the AOP label, which makes it essential that the 32 selected valley and mountain dairies producing this cheese comply with the strict quality requirements. It is a full fat cheese containing 45% of fat in dry matter.\nSbrinz AOP is a 100% natural product since it made from first-class raw milk, rennet and salt without any additives. It takes extremely long time for the cheese to mature, a minimum of 18 months before it can be savored. The longer the cheese is matured, the more aromatic and spicy it tastes. It can be eaten in three different ways, depending on the age of cheese. At 18 months Sbrinz can be sliced or shaved into rolls. At the age of 24 months or even longer, Sbrinz develops its full flavour and is served as an aperitif or broken up into pieces (“Möckli”) on a cheeseboard. Last but not the least, grated Sbrinz with its spicy aroma is perfect for adding a finishing to many pasta, risotto or au gratin dishes. This versatile cheese is often used instead of Parmesan cheese in Swiss cuisine."

   "Description": "Scamorza is an Italian, spun paste cow’s milk cheese belonging to the pasta filata family. Shaped similar to a provolone in pear shape, it is available in many other forms as well. A semi-soft white cheese with a texture comparable to that of a firm, dry Mozzarella, Scamorza is made throughout Apulia and in some parts of Campania and Molise.\nThe cheese is made from pasteurised cow’s milk or from a mixture of cow and sheep milk. At the end of the cheese making process, which is akin to Mozzarella, the cheeses are hanged together in strings to ripen for about two weeks. The process of ripening the cheese has given Scamorza its name, which in southern Italy means ‘beheaded’.\n \nAfter two weeks of ripening, the cheese is sold as it is or smoked. The smoked variant, called ‘Scamorzi Affumicate’ is made by smoking the cheese over flaming straw for around 10 to 15 minutes. A fresh version of Scamorza is also sold within a few days of production.\nThe texture of Scamorza is elastic, stringy and has less moisture than Mozzarella. In addition, the flavour is more piquant, milky and creamy. Smoked Scamorza has a subtle, smoky flavour with a sweet, light caramel note.\nScamorza is used as a substitute for Mozzarella as it imparts more interest in the recipe. Since Scamorza has excellent melting qualities, it is best known to flavour baking dishes, for griddling or topped with prosciutto for extra zest. The smoky flavour of Scamorza pairs well with oak-aged Chardonnay, Pinot Girgio or Orvieto."

Later, the Shanklish balls are rinsed to remove off the mould and coated in dried zaatar or thyme. To make spicy Shanklish, spices such as aniseed and chilli is mixed in before the cheese is rolled into balls.Fresh Shanklish tastes mild with a soft texture, while those dried and aged for longer periods are darker and pungent in odour and flavour. Cheese found around Tartus, Akkar are particularly appetizing, as they tend to be hard with a clean, strong flavour and whitish colour.

It is sold at different ages from ten months up to four years. The texture is firm, dry and becomes increasingly brittle with age. The flavours of Jack cheese may range from mild and mellow to high moisture Jacks to spicy, delicate and buttery in peppered versions.

The cheesemakers could not legally use the name 'Stilton' since it is granted the status of PDO by the European Commission. Therefore, they decided to use an early form of the name of the Stilton village mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book (Stichiltone/Sticiltone).\nThe flavours of the creamy white cheese are nutty and reminiscent of apples with underlying toasty notes. The delicate veins of blue-green mould beneath the rusty-coloured, orange-brown rind behold a spicy, savoury element and a long-lasting caramel-like sweetness."

The rind is washed in Perry, an alcoholic drink made with the local variety of Stinking Bishop pear, which gives the cheese its name. The alcoholic wash gives the cheese its distinctive pungent aroma and brown/pink rind colour. As a result of the natural rind, changeable hues of mould spots appear on the cheese from time to time.\nThis unique cheese dates its history to the Cistercian order of monks. To keep up with the tradition of monastic cheeses, Stinking Bishop is also matured in humid cave-like conditions.\nThe colour of the cheese paste varies from white-yellow to beige, with an orange to a grey rind. It is available in 5lbs wheels, each measuring 8-inches in diameter and 2-inches deep. The affinage takes from six to eight weeks. Stinking Bishop is produced in very limited quantities but its stinky smell has made it very popular in the United Kingdom and abroad."

It can be enjoyed throughout the year since cows milk never goes out of stock.\nSwaledale tastes the best if eaten when it is between 4 and 6 weeks old. Moreover, it proves to be a fantastic cooking cheese for preparing French cheese stews Tartiflette Au Reblochon."

While it has a firmer texture than baby Swiss, its flavour is mild, sweet and nut-like. It has a savoury, but not very sharp taste. Some types of Swiss cheese have a distinctive appearance. Some cheeses have holes known as 'eyes' while some do not. Swiss cheese without eyes is known as 'blind'. But in general, the larger the eyes in Swiss cheese, the more pronounced its flavour!\nThe process of Swiss cheese making is designed in a way that no rind forms on the cheese. It can be eaten with fruits such as apples, pears, grapes and thinly-sliced prosciutto ham and salami. Fruity white wine, aged red wine, cran-raspberry juice, tomato or vegetable juices also prove to be great pairs for Swiss cheese."

During cheese making, the acidic milk is brought to the lab and kept on the wood shelves in the chambers as well in caves according to tradition. In order to prevent the cheese from mould infestation, it is washed with seawater once a week. The maturation takes 6 - 10 weeks forming a thin crust.\nThese days the cheese is made from both pasteurised and unpasteurised milk in factories. These factory-made cheeses have brighter and moderate flavours.\nTaleggio has been granted a PDO designation and contains 48% fat. The cheese has a strong smell, but the taste is relatively mild with an unusual fruity tang. Taleggio can be served grated on salads. Since it melts well, it can be used in risotto or on polenta."

This cheese is also made in other parts of Switzerland including the Jura Mountains on the border of France.\nThe milk for the cheese is sourced from Fribourgeois breed of cows that graze on the Alpine grass and wildflowers all the way through the late spring and summer. As early fall arrives, the cows are brought down to graze on grass and summer hay. No other fodder is given to the cows except the Alpine meadows.\nThis traditional cheese making process ensures that Vacherin Fribourgeois has a pleasant nutty flavour underpinned by notes of fresh hay and milk. Vacherin has an unpalatable natural and brushed washed rind with a stinky aroma, but it does not overpower the lovely smell of the cheese. The interior of the cheese is straw coloured with an open and buttery texture.\nToday Vacherin Fribourgeois is produced only by a small number of artisanal cheese makers and hence is very difficult to find. It has a Swiss AOC status with 6 varieties available: Classic (aged 6-12 weeks), Extra (aged minimum 12 weeks), Rustic (aged minimum 12 weeks, but up to 25 weeks (6 months)), Alpage (aged 12–25 weeks), Mountain (aged 9–25 weeks) and Organic (aged minimum 9 weeks).\nVacherin Fribourgeois is used in fondues, cooking and as a table cheese. It is a great melting cheese, so try it on grilled sandwiches, potatoes or over steamed vegetables. Big and bold Burgundy’s, Bordeaux or reds from the Rhone Valley in France will complement the cheese well."

   "Description": "In 1872, Eleonora Lindstrom of Sweden discovered the recipe of Västerbottensost by accident when the milk was left to curdle longer than needed. Today, it is produced only by Norrmejerier Swedish dairy company at their Burträsk farm. The Swedes salute it as the “Emperor of cheeses”.\nVästerbottensost is a hard, granular cheese with a distinct character and powerful aromatic aroma. The taste is said to be similar to Parmesan cheese; salty but with sweeter notes. Also, the texture is crumblier than an Italian Parmigianino Reggiano. It is a slow-maturing cheese with a ripening period of a minimum one year. Light yellow in colour, Västerbottensost is a full-fat cheese containing 31% fat. Since the production is limited, it is twice as expensive compared to other aged cheeses. It is usually produced in the shape of a wheel, with smooth, yellow waxed rind.\nSwedish enjoy this cheese at August crayfish parties and is a must-have ingredient in the highly popular Västerbotten cheese pie."

   "Description": "Venaco is a washed rind cheese produced from raw, whole sheep’s milk, though some shepherds use goat’s milk. It is produced in the mountainous regions of Haute Corsica using natural rennet. The name of the cheese is derived from a village called Venaco that lies in the centre of the island.\nThe cheese is matured for 1-2 weeks before it is dipped in brine and left to mature in a moist cheese cellar. The rind of the cheese is red-orange in colour while the insides reveal an ivory soft pate. A 24-48 hours fresh variant can sometimes be used for cooking but essentially 2-3 months matured Venaco makes a perfect addition to a cheese platter. At 6 months, an intensely mature Venaco can be used as a grating cheese on pasta and soups.\nThe aroma of Venaco is complex, complemented by a powerful, melt-in-the-mouth taste. A great place to try Corsican cheeses is at the Venaco cheese fair, A Fiera di U Casgiu, in early May. Venaco is a fremier cheese that has to be produced from the milk of a single herd."

When it is young, the chevre is thin-skinned, white, and slightly wrinkled, but as it starts to ripen, the Geotrichum and Candidum rind becomes more wrinkled allowing the ash to shine through. The pate becomes denser and finally, at three to five weeks, the cheese is drier and crumbly. Though, it can be enjoyed in all its stages.\nWabash Cannonball is a dense sphere with a gentle, creamy, slightly acidic flavour with clean citrusy hints. The rind is a fluffy mushroomy snowball-like covering of Penicillium Candidum mould which gives way to a deeply wrinkled surface of Geotrichum Candidum as it matures. At its optimum age, the cheese is musky, slightly sweet with a more delicate flavour.\nCannonball is best on a cheeseboard, served with dry white wines such as Sauvignon Blanc or Gruner Veltliner.

With the access of technology from England in 1850s, it started making more than 160 varieties of cheeses.\nWashed rind cheeses are originally from the alleys of northern France, made famous by the monks who invented them. It was a deliberate attempt to develop the meaty flavour in the cheese as people have to abstain from meat for long periods of time. Washed rind cheeses are periodically washed in a solution of saltwater brine, wines and/or mould-bearing agents so that their surface becomes responsive to bacteria. This bacterium (Brevibacterium Linens) “smears” the cheese with a firm, palatable, bright red/orange rind and imparts pungent odours and distinctive flavours to the product. Also known as surface ripened, the cheeses can be soft, semi-hard, or hard. Some common examples are Titlist, Gruyere and Raclette who have their rinds washed during the maturation process to develop a crusty shell.\nThis rich cheese has a robust aroma with a sweet, earthy flavour that is a little nutty. Since the cheese is complex in taste, pair it with fruits or toasted fruit bread."

The art of making the cheese was passed by the monks to the farmer's wives who produced a blue variety of Wensleydale at their farmhouses. Today, Wensleydale is produced mainly from pasteurised cow's milk and sheep's milk to enhance the flavour. Wensleydale Creamery in the town of Hawes is seeking to protect the name Yorkshire Wensleydale Cheese under PDO designation. But there are other producers of Wensleydale cheese in parts of the UK, mainly in Shropshire and Cheshire.\nWensleydale Creamery produces five types of Wensleydale cheese depending on the age and flavours - Real Yorkshire Wensleydale, Mature Wensleydale, Extra Mature Wensleydale, Blue Wensleydale and Oak Smoked Wensleydale.\nA Real Yorkshire Wensleydale is creamy-white in colour has a supple, crumbly, moist and flaky texture. It appears similar to a young Caerphilly. The flavour is mild, clean, and slightly sweet with hints of wild honey savour and fresh acidity. As it ages the cheese develops a fuller, deeper flavour as well becomes firmer. Yorkshire Wensleydale cheese produced by Wensleydale Creamery is available in truckles/cylinders or block shaped in varying shapes and sizes up to 25kg.\nWensleydale goes well with fruit cake, apple and is a perfect accompaniment during lunchtime or tea time. It also tastes delicious with hot desserts like fruit pies and crumbles. It is the king of cheeseboard where its fresh, milky sweetness and robust flavours rule the roost.\nVarieties:\nOak Smoked Wensleydale is produced by naturally smoking the cheese for 18 hours using oak chips, to create a subtle, smoked flavour. It is the same as Real Yorkshire Wensleydale except for the striking golden beech colour and the robust flavour imparted by the smokiness.\nMature Wensleydale is a harder, flavoured variant of Wensleydale.\nExtra Mature Wensleydale is the strongest Wensleydale aged for nine months.\nBlue Wensleydale is a blue-veined cheese that has been the supreme champion winner at the British Cheese Awards 2012.\nUnpasteurized Wensleydale handcrafted from a single dairy herd is also available. It has a complex lemony flavour with a buttery and creamy texture.\nBlended Wensleydale, flavoured with delicate fruits like cranberries, apricots, pineapples, ginger, garlic and chives is one of the favourites buys at the creamery.\nWensleydale cheeses complement fruity white wine such as Pinot Grigio."
