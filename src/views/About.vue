    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h2>What is Server vs Server?</h2>
    <p>
      Weâ€™re a Discord-based music-making festival that began Spring 2020, in
      response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We unite the rich variety of online
      music communities that have been growing on Discord by our simple shared
      goal: making music! The core of the event is that each server produces
      their own collaborative EP based on the same theme/prompt, over a set
      competition period. A server can organize to create an EP however they
      like, as long as a minimum of three different people contribute to each
      track- the spirit of the competition is to bring your server together to
      collaborate on one big project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout and following the competition period, we hold several
      livestreams raising money for a music charity- our last event, SvS III
      raised $3,275.58 for Mr Hollandâ€™s Opus through Tiltify!
    </p>

    <h2>Why should my community take part?</h2>
    <p>
      Weâ€™ve found taking part in this competition brings out something really
      special in the communities that participate. The stakes boil down to
      bragging rights, so the element of friendly competition combined with the
      push for your server to produce an entire EP together (within a time
      limit) sends community spirit through the roof as well as giving you and
      your community something to be incredibly proud of afterwards.
    </p>
    <h2>How did Server vs Server Begin?</h2>
    <p>
      Server vs Server started in a Discord-based community called Artistry in
      April 2020. It started off as an idea to have a fun competition to work on
      during what was the early days of quarantine for most countries: 4 teams
      from different online music communities would be mandated to create an EP
      of original music during a set time period, concluding with a listening
      party / online festival to showcase all the completed music to all the
      communities involved. The nature of the event being between online
      communities based in different Discord Servers gave rise to the name
      Server versus Server.
    </p>
    <p>
      As more servers were contacted to take part, this small-scale idea quickly
      exploded in popularity, quickly growing into what was at the time
      Discord's largest inter-server event - 16 communities spent 3 weeks to
      craft a 12 minute EP within their servers. The output of all the hard work
      was celebrated with a 2 day festival held on Twitch and thus a tradition
      was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months passed and the music communities that had taken part in the
      first competition were itching for a second round: in July 2020 we kicked
      off our second edition of SvS - this time with 18 servers competing, this
      time each making 15 minute eps. SvS was becoming too big for a single
      community to run it so we formed a coalition of servers that would work to
      run cross-community events for the foreseeable future.
    </p>
    <p>
      SvS II was a big success but the team wasnâ€™t satisfied yet. After a
      recovery period the team got to work on the third installment of SvS. This
      time getting 30 servers involved. By this time communities were reaching
      out to us to join the event. Recognising the reach and audience SvS was
      developing, we strove to direct that energy and engagement towards social
      good, with the introduction of charity fundraising to our livestreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      We set out with the goal of raising one thousand dollars for charity.
      Across the span of the event , this number quickly grew to 2 thousand, and
      then 3 thousand. We reached a whopping $3,275.58 cents raised for charity.
      We were also able to get Splice involved with SvS III to provide our
      audience with voucher codes for their website.
    </p>
    <p>
      In October of 2021 we were approached by Lucid Monday to help run a
      competitive event - a bracket tournament consisting of 16 10-member teams
      who would face off in a series of beat battles (similar in nature to
      Versuz on IG) in the ultimate goal to win $1000 dollars. The event was a
      great success garnering thousands of views across the tournament.
    </p>
    <p>
      In parallel, our newly expanded team started plans to kick off SvS IV
      slated for a March 26th start date, after establishing a comprehensive
      Code of Conduct fitting of the scale of the event to firmly set expected
      behaviour within the event.
