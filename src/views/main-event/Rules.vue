        SvS Competition Rules
      </h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h2>Each server will make an EP that meets the following criteria:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Must consist of at least 3 tracks (there is no upper limit) and 1 album cover for the whole EP.
            </li>
            <li>
              Must be between 10 and 15 minutes long. This is a hard limit and will be strictly enforced, so take this into consideration while making creative decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Must be based on the theme provided at the start of the competition.
            </li>
            <li>
              Bonus tracks and other additional auditory content will not be accepted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Servers <em>may</em> include 1 video/visualizer file to accompany the entire EP, if desired.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the competition and as part of the final submission, no participant may receive compensation for their contribution to a song or composition, its production, or engineering.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Track criteria:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Must include musical contributions (ie composition, recordings, engineering - not feedback or “inspiration”) from at least 3 server members.
            </li>
            <li>
              Must not be started before the official start of competition (no prior work allowed).
            </li>
            <li>
              Must not contain any full external acapellas or instrumentals.
            </li>
            <li>
              May use samples and extra assets (this is not counted as a contribution however).
            </li>
            <li>
              Must not be a cover or remix of an existing song.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Submission Criteria:</h2>
          <blockquote>
            <strong>Change!</strong><br>
            Due to changes in the submission system compared to previous editions: 
            <ul>
              <li><em>(Rule C.1)</em> the ZIP file is no longer mandatory</li>
              <li><em>(Rule C.1.c)</em> the .txt containing contributions/lyrics is no longer mandatory. </li>
            </ul>
            Instead fill the corresponding fields in the form.
          </blockquote>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Each EP must be submitted for playback for the stream as a ZIP file containing:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Each submitted track in its own mp3 file.
                </li>
                <li>
                  An image file containing the cover art as a 3000x3000px PNG, GIF, or JPG/JPEG.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A text file (.txt) containing the names of the contributors to each track and cover art and a record/example of their contribution; this is in addition to filling out the same information in the submission form.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If applicable, a text file containing the full lyrics to each track.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              Track files must be in 320kbps mp3 format; tracks will be normalised during the listening festival livestream, so it is strongly advised to aim for -14 integrated LUFS when mastering  (as is the loudness standard for Spotify) to avoid any issues during livestream playback.
            </li>
            <li>
              Track files must be named “Server Name - Track # - Track Name”
            </li>
            <li>
              The EP must be submitted through our website before the deadline to be counted.
            </li>
            <li>
              You must also submit a Youtube, Soundcloud, Audius, or Bandcamp link to your EP alongside your ZIP. This can be a private/unlisted link if you prefer, but there must be a way to stream your submission available by the deadline.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>
                By submitting an EP to the competition, you give SvS permission to use your EP as part of any of our future livestreams (and therefore VODs).
              </strong>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Application of Rules:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              If there is any question about the competition rules, how to interpret them, or how to apply them, at least 3 SvS event staff will make a decision as fairly as possible. No organiser, admin, or mod may participate in a decision directly related to servers they participate in.
            </li>
            <li>
              Failure to follow the submission rules above will result in a server being disqualified from the ballot for awards (this does not necessitate suspension from the competition).
            </li>
            <li>
              Failure to follow our <a href="/code-of-conduct">code of conduct</a> may result in a server being suspended or banned from the competition outright.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Award Voting:</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Every member of the participating servers will be allowed to vote for awards after the festival via our website; More details will be provided in the future.
            </li>
            <li>
              Servers MAY NOT vote for any of their own works. Doing so will lead to immediate disqualification.
            </li>
            <li>
              Some awards that will be up for grabs include:
